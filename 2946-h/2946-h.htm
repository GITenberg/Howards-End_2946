    <p>
      &ldquo;Howards End,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tuesday.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dearest Meg,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t going to be what we expected. It is old and little, and
      altogether delightful&mdash;red brick. We can scarcely pack in as it is,
      and the dear knows what will happen when Paul (younger son) arrives
      to-morrow. From hall you go right or left into dining-room or
      drawing-room. Hall itself is practically a room. You open another door in
      it, and there are the stairs going up in a sort of tunnel to the
      first-floor. Three bed-rooms in a row there, and three attics in a row
      above. That isn&rsquo;t all the house really, but it&rsquo;s all that one notices&mdash;nine
      windows as you look up from the front garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then there&rsquo;s a very big wych-elm&mdash;to the left as you look up&mdash;leaning
      a little over the house, and standing on the boundary between the garden
      and meadow. I quite love that tree already. Also ordinary elms, oaks&mdash;no
      nastier than ordinary oaks&mdash;pear-trees, apple-trees, and a vine. No
      silver birches, though. However, I must get on to my host and hostess. I
      only wanted to show that it isn&rsquo;t the least what we expected. Why did we
      settle that their house would be all gables and wiggles, and their garden
      all gamboge-coloured paths? I believe simply because we associate them
      with expensive hotels&mdash;Mrs. Wilcox trailing in beautiful dresses down
      long corridors, Mr. Wilcox bullying porters, etc. We females are that
      unjust.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be back Saturday; will let you know train later. They are as
      angry as I am that you did not come too; really Tibby is too tiresome, he
      starts a new mortal disease every month. How could he have got hay fever
      in London? and even if he could, it seems hard that you should give up a
      visit to hear a schoolboy sneeze. Tell him that Charles Wilcox (the son
      who is here) has hay fever too, but he&rsquo;s brave, and gets quite cross when
      we inquire after it. Men like the Wilcoxes would do Tibby a power of good.
      But you won&rsquo;t agree, and I&rsquo;d better change the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This long letter is because I&rsquo;m writing before breakfast. Oh, the
      beautiful vine leaves! The house is covered with a vine. I looked out
      earlier, and Mrs. Wilcox was already in the garden. She evidently loves
      it. No wonder she sometimes looks tired. She was watching the large red
      poppies come out. Then she walked off the lawn to the meadow, whose corner
      to the right I can just see. Trail, trail, went her long dress over the
      sopping grass, and she came back with her hands full of the hay that was
      cut yesterday&mdash;I suppose for rabbits or something, as she kept on
      smelling it. The air here is delicious. Later on I heard the noise of
      croquet balls, and looked out again, and it was Charles Wilcox practising;
      they are keen on all games. Presently he started sneezing and had to stop.
      Then I hear more clicketing, and it is Mr. Wilcox practising, and then,
      &lsquo;a-tissue, a-tissue&rsquo;: he has to stop too. Then Evie comes out, and does
      some calisthenic exercises on a machine that is tacked on to a
      green-gage-tree&mdash;they put everything to use&mdash;and then she says
      &lsquo;a-tissue,&rsquo; and in she goes. And finally Mrs. Wilcox reappears, trail,
      trail, still smelling hay and looking at the flowers. I inflict all this
      on you because once you said that life is sometimes life and sometimes
      only a drama, and one must learn to distinguish tother from which, and up
      to now I have always put that down as &lsquo;Meg&rsquo;s clever nonsense.&rsquo; But this
      morning, it really does seem not life but a play, and it did amuse me
      enormously to watch the W&rsquo;s. Now Mrs. Wilcox has come in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to wear [omission]. Last night Mrs. Wilcox wore an [omission],
      and Evie [omission]. So it isn&rsquo;t exactly a go-as-you-please place, and if
      you shut your eyes it still seems the wiggly hotel that we expected. Not
      if you open them. The dog-roses are too sweet. There is a great hedge of
      them over the lawn&mdash;magnificently tall, so that they fall down in
      garlands, and nice and thin at the bottom, so that you can see ducks
      through it and a cow. These belong to the farm, which is the only house
      near us. There goes the breakfast gong. Much love. Modified love to Tibby.
      Love to Aunt Juley; how good of her to come and keep you company, but what
      a bore. Burn this. Will write again Thursday.

    <p>
      &ldquo;Friday
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dearest Meg,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am having a glorious time. I like them all. Mrs. Wilcox, if quieter
      than in Germany, is sweeter than ever, and I never saw anything like her
      steady unselfishness, and the best of it is that the others do not take
      advantage of her. They are the very happiest, jolliest family that you can
      imagine. I do really feel that we are making friends. The fun of it is
      that they think me a noodle, and say so&mdash;at least, Mr. Wilcox does&mdash;and
      when that happens, and one doesn&rsquo;t mind, it&rsquo;s a pretty sure test, isn&rsquo;t
      it? He says the most horrid things about woman&rsquo;s suffrage so nicely, and
      when I said I believed in equality he just folded his arms and gave me
      such a setting down as I&rsquo;ve never had. Meg, shall we ever learn to talk
      less? I never felt so ashamed of myself in my life. I couldn&rsquo;t point to a
      time when men had been equal, nor even to a time when the wish to be equal
      had made them happier in other ways. I couldn&rsquo;t say a word. I had just
      picked up the notion that equality is good from some book&mdash;probably
      from poetry, or you. Anyhow, it&rsquo;s been knocked into pieces, and, like all
      people who are really strong, Mr. Wilcox did it without hurting me. On the
      other hand, I laugh at them for catching hay fever. We live like
      fighting-cocks, and Charles takes us out every day in the motor&mdash;a
      tomb with trees in it, a hermit&rsquo;s house, a wonderful road that was made by
      the Kings of Mercia&mdash;tennis&mdash;a cricket match&mdash;bridge and at
      night we squeeze up in this lovely house. The whole clan&rsquo;s here now&mdash;it&rsquo;s
      like a rabbit warren. Evie is a dear. They want me to stop over Sunday&mdash;I
      suppose it won&rsquo;t matter if I do. Marvellous weather and the views
      marvellous&mdash;views westward to the high ground. Thank you for your
      letter. Burn this.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II
    </h2>
    <p>
      Margaret glanced at her sister&rsquo;s note and pushed it over the
      breakfast-table to her aunt. There was a moment&rsquo;s hush, and then the
      flood-gates opened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can tell you nothing, Aunt Juley. I know no more than you do. We met&mdash;we
      only met the father and mother abroad last spring. I know so little that I
      didn&rsquo;t even know their son&rsquo;s name. It&rsquo;s all so&mdash;&rdquo; She waved her hand
      and laughed a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case it is far too sudden.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who knows, Aunt Juley, who knows?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Margaret, dear, I mean, we mustn&rsquo;t be unpractical now that we&rsquo;ve
      come to facts. It is too sudden, surely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who knows!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Margaret, dear&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go for her other letters,&rdquo; said Margaret. &ldquo;No, I won&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;ll finish
      my breakfast. In fact, I haven&rsquo;t them. We met the Wilcoxes on an awful
      expedition that we made from Heidelberg to Speyer. Helen and I had got it
      into our heads that there was a grand old cathedral at Speyer&mdash;the
      Archbishop of Speyer was one of the seven electors&mdash;you know&mdash;&lsquo;Speyer,
      Maintz, and Koln.&rsquo; Those three sees once commanded the Rhine Valley and
      got it the name of Priest Street.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I still feel quite uneasy about this business, Margaret.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The train crossed by a bridge of boats, and at first sight it looked
      quite fine. But oh, in five minutes we had seen the whole thing. The
      cathedral had been ruined, absolutely ruined, by restoration; not an inch
      left of the original structure. We wasted a whole day, and came across the
      Wilcoxes as we were eating our sandwiches in the public gardens. They too,
      poor things, had been taken in&mdash;they were actually stopping at Speyer&mdash;and
      they rather liked Helen&rsquo;s insisting that they must fly with us to
      Heidelberg. As a matter of fact, they did come on next day. We all took
      some drives together. They knew us well enough to ask Helen to come and
      see them&mdash;at least, I was asked too, but Tibby&rsquo;s illness prevented
      me, so last Monday she went alone. That&rsquo;s all. You know as much as I do
      now. It&rsquo;s a young man out of the unknown. She was to have come back
      Saturday, but put off till Monday, perhaps on account of&mdash;I don&rsquo;t
      know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She broke off, and listened to the sounds of a London morning. Their house
      was in Wickham Place, and fairly quiet, for a lofty promontory of
      buildings separated it from the main thoroughfare. One had the sense of a
      backwater, or rather of an estuary, whose waters flowed in from the
      invisible sea, and ebbed into a profound silence while the waves without
      were still beating. Though the promontory consisted of flats&mdash;expensive,
      with cavernous entrance halls, full of concierges and palms&mdash;it
      fulfilled its purpose, and gained for the older houses opposite a certain
      measure of peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      These, too, would be swept away in time, and another promontory would
      arise upon their site, as humanity piled itself higher and higher on the
      precious soil of London.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Munt had her own method of interpreting her nieces. She decided that
      Margaret was a little hysterical, and was trying to gain time by a torrent
      of talk. Feeling very diplomatic, she lamented the fate of Speyer, and
      declared that never, never should she be so misguided as to visit it, and
      added of her own accord that the principles of restoration were ill
      understood in Germany. &ldquo;The Germans,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;are too thorough, and
      this is all very well sometimes, but at other times it does not do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; said Margaret; &ldquo;Germans are too thorough.&rdquo; And her eyes began
      to shine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I regard you Schlegels as English,&rdquo; said Mrs. Munt hastily&mdash;&ldquo;English
      to the backbone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret leaned forward and stroked her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that reminds me&mdash;Helen&rsquo;s letter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, Aunt Juley, I am thinking all right about Helen&rsquo;s letter. I know&mdash;I
      must go down and see her. I am thinking about her all right. I am meaning
      to go down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But go with some plan,&rdquo; said Mrs. Munt, admitting into her kindly voice a
      note of exasperation. &ldquo;Margaret, if I may interfere, don&rsquo;t be taken by
      surprise. What do you think of the Wilcoxes? Are they our sort? Are they
      likely people? Could they appreciate Helen, who is to my mind a very
      special sort of person? Do they care about Literature and Art? That is
      most important when you come to think of it. Literature and Art. Most
      important. How old would the son be? She says &lsquo;younger son.&rsquo; Would he be
      in a position to marry? Is he likely to make Helen happy? Did you gather&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I gathered nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They began to talk at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then in that case&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case I can make no plans, don&rsquo;t you see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hate plans. I hate lines of action. Helen isn&rsquo;t a baby.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then in that case, my dear, why go down?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret was silent. If her aunt could not see why she must go down, she
      was not going to tell her. She was not going to say, &ldquo;I love my dear
      sister; I must be near her at this crisis of her life.&rdquo; The affections are
      more reticent than the passions, and their expression more subtle. If she
      herself should ever fall in love with a man, she, like Helen, would
      proclaim it from the housetops, but as she loved only a sister she used
      the voiceless language of sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I consider you odd girls,&rdquo; continued Mrs. Munt, &ldquo;and very wonderful
      girls, and in many ways far older than your years. But&mdash;you won&rsquo;t be
      offended? frankly, I feel you are not up to this business. It requires an
      older person. Dear, I have nothing to call me back to Swanage.&rdquo; She spread
      out her plump arms. &ldquo;I am all at your disposal. Let me go down to this
      house whose name I forget instead of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aunt Juley&rdquo;&mdash;she jumped up and kissed her&mdash;&ldquo;I must, must go to
      Howards End myself. You don&rsquo;t exactly understand, though I can never thank
      you properly for offering.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do understand,&rdquo; retorted Mrs. Munt, with immense confidence. &ldquo;I go down
      in no spirit of interference, but to make inquiries. Inquiries are
      necessary. Now, I am going to be rude. You would say the wrong thing; to a
      certainty you would. In your anxiety for Helen&rsquo;s happiness you would
      offend the whole of these Wilcoxes by asking one of your impetuous
      questions&mdash;not that one minds offending them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall ask no questions. I have it in Helen&rsquo;s writing that she and a man
      are in love. There is no question to ask as long as she keeps to that. All
      the rest isn&rsquo;t worth a straw. A long engagement if you like, but
      inquiries, questions, plans, lines of action&mdash;no, Aunt Juley, no.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Away she hurried, not beautiful, not supremely brilliant, but filled with
      something that took the place of both qualities&mdash;something best
      described as a profound vivacity, a continual and sincere response to all
      that she encountered in her path through life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Helen had written the same to me about a shop assistant or a penniless
      clerk&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Margaret, do come into the library and shut the door. Your good
      maids are dusting the banisters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;or if she had wanted to marry the man who calls for Carter
      Paterson, I should have said the same.&rdquo; Then, with one of those turns that
      convinced her aunt that she was not mad really, and convinced observers of
      another type that she was not a barren theorist, she added: &ldquo;Though in the
      case of Carter Paterson I should want it to be a very long engagement
      indeed, I must say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think so,&rdquo; said Mrs. Munt; &ldquo;and, indeed, I can scarcely follow
      you. Now, just imagine if you said anything of that sort to the Wilcoxes.
      I understand it, but most good people would think you mad. Imagine how
      disconcerting for Helen! What is wanted is a person who will go slowly,
      slowly in this business, and see how things are and where they are likely
      to lead to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret was down on this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you implied just now that the engagement must be broken off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think probably it must; but slowly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you break an engagement off slowly?&rdquo; Her eyes lit up. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s an
      engagement made of, do you suppose? I think it&rsquo;s made of some hard stuff
      that may snap, but can&rsquo;t break. It is different to the other ties of life.
      They stretch or bend. They admit of degree. They&rsquo;re different.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly so. But won&rsquo;t you let me just run down to Howards House, and save
      you all the discomfort? I will really not interfere, but I do so
      thoroughly understand the kind of thing you Schlegels want that one quiet
      look round will be enough for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret again thanked her, again kissed her, and then ran upstairs to see
      her brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not so well.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hay fever had worried him a good deal all night. His head ached, his
      eyes were wet, his mucous membrane, he informed her, in a most
      unsatisfactory condition. The only thing that made life worth living was
      the thought of Walter Savage Landor, from whose Imaginary Conversations
      she had promised to read at frequent intervals during the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was rather difficult. Something must be done about Helen. She must be
      assured that it is not a criminal offence to love at first sight. A
      telegram to this effect would be cold and cryptic, a personal visit seemed
      each moment more impossible. Now the doctor arrived, and said that Tibby
      was quite bad. Might it really be best to accept Aunt Juley&rsquo;s kind offer,
      and to send her down to Howards End with a note?
    </p>
    <p>
      Certainly Margaret was impulsive. She did swing rapidly from one decision
      to another. Running downstairs into the library, she cried: &ldquo;Yes, I have
      changed my mind; I do wish that you would go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a train from King&rsquo;s Cross at eleven. At half-past ten Tibby,
      with rare self-effacement, fell asleep, and Margaret was able to drive her
      aunt to the station.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will remember, Aunt Juley, not to be drawn into discussing the
      engagement. Give my letter to Helen, and say whatever you feel yourself,
      but do keep clear of the relatives. We have scarcely got their names
      straight yet, and, besides, that sort of thing is so uncivilised and
      wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So uncivilised?&rdquo; queried Mrs. Munt, fearing that she was losing the point
      of some brilliant remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I used an affected word. I only meant would you please talk the thing
      over only with Helen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only with Helen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because&mdash;&rdquo; But it was no moment to expound the personal nature of
      love. Even Margaret shrank from it, and contented herself with stroking
      her good aunt&rsquo;s hand, and with meditating, half sensibly and half
      poetically, on the journey that was about to begin from King&rsquo;s Cross.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like many others who have lived long in a great capital, she had strong
      feelings about the various railway termini. They are our gates to the
      glorious and the unknown. Through them we pass out into adventure and
      sunshine, to them, alas! we return. In Paddington all Cornwall is latent
      and the remoter west; down the inclines of Liverpool Street lie fenlands
      and the illimitable Broads; Scotland is through the pylons of Euston;
      Wessex behind the poised chaos of Waterloo. Italians realise this, as is
      natural; those of them who are so unfortunate as to serve as waiters in
      Berlin call the Anhalt Bahnhof the Stazione d&rsquo;Italia, because by it they
      must return to their homes. And he is a chilly Londoner who does not endow
      his stations with some personality, and extend to them, however shyly, the
      emotions of fear and love.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Margaret&mdash;I hope that it will not set the reader against her&mdash;the
      station of King&rsquo;s Cross had always suggested Infinity. Its very situation&mdash;withdrawn
      a little behind the facile splendours of St. Pancras&mdash;implied a
      comment on the materialism of life. Those two great arches, colourless,
      indifferent, shouldering between them an unlovely clock, were fit portals
      for some eternal adventure, whose issue might be prosperous, but would
      certainly not be expressed in the ordinary language of prosperity. If you
      think this ridiculous, remember that it is not Margaret who is telling you
      about it; and let me hasten to add that they were in plenty of time for
      the train; that Mrs. Munt, though she took a second-class ticket, was put
      by the guard into a first (only two &ldquo;seconds&rdquo; on the train, one smoking
      and the other babies&mdash;one cannot be expected to travel with babies);
      and that Margaret, on her return to Wickham Place, was confronted with the
      following telegram:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All over. Wish I had never written. Tell no one&mdash;, HELEN.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Aunt Juley was gone&mdash;gone irrevocably, and no power on earth
      could stop her.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III
    </h2>
    <p>
      Most complacently did Mrs. Munt rehearse her mission. Her nieces were
      independent young women, and it was not often that she was able to help
      them. Emily&rsquo;s daughters had never been quite like other girls. They had
      been left motherless when Tibby was born, when Helen was five and Margaret
      herself but thirteen. It was before the passing of the Deceased Wife&rsquo;s
      Sister Bill, so Mrs. Munt could without impropriety offer to go and keep
      house at Wickham Place. But her brother-in-law, who was peculiar and a
      German, had referred the question to Margaret, who with the crudity of
      youth had answered, &ldquo;No, they could manage much better alone.&rdquo; Five years
      later Mr. Schlegel had died too, and Mrs. Munt had repeated her offer.
      Margaret, crude no longer, had been grateful and extremely nice, but the
      substance of her answer had been the same. &ldquo;I must not interfere a third
      time,&rdquo; thought Mrs. Munt. However, of course she did. She learnt, to her
      horror, that Margaret, now of age, was taking her money out of the old
      safe investments and putting it into Foreign Things, which always smash.
      Silence would have been criminal. Her own fortune was invested in Home
      Rails, and most ardently did she beg her niece to imitate her. &ldquo;Then we
      should be together, dear.&rdquo; Margaret, out of politeness, invested a few
      hundreds in the Nottingham and Derby Railway, and though the Foreign
      Things did admirably and the Nottingham and Derby declined with the steady
      dignity of which only Home Rails are capable, Mrs. Munt never ceased to
      rejoice, and to say, &ldquo;I did manage that, at all events. When the smash
      comes poor Margaret will have a nest-egg to fall back upon.&rdquo; This year
      Helen came of age, and exactly the same thing happened in Helen&rsquo;s case;
      she also would shift her money out of Consols, but she, too, almost
      without being pressed, consecrated a fraction of it to the Nottingham and
      Derby Railway. So far so good, but in social matters their aunt had
      accomplished nothing. Sooner or later the girls would enter on the process
      known as throwing themselves away, and if they had delayed hitherto, it
      was only that they might throw themselves more vehemently in the future.
      They saw too many people at Wickham Place&mdash;unshaven musicians, an
      actress even, German cousins (one knows what foreigners are),
      acquaintances picked up at Continental hotels (one knows what they are
      too). It was interesting, and down at Swanage no one appreciated culture
      more than Mrs. Munt; but it was dangerous, and disaster was bound to come.
      How right she was, and how lucky to be on the spot when the disaster came!
    </p>
    <p>
      The train sped northward, under innumerable tunnels. It was only an hour&rsquo;s
      journey, but Mrs. Munt had to raise and lower the window again and again.
      She passed through the South Welwyn Tunnel, saw light for a moment, and
      entered the North Welwyn Tunnel, of tragic fame. She traversed the immense
      viaduct, whose arches span untroubled meadows and the dreamy flow of Tewin
      Water. She skirted the parks of politicians. At times the Great North Road
      accompanied her, more suggestive of infinity than any railway, awakening,
      after a nap of a hundred years, to such life as is conferred by the stench
      of motor-cars, and to such culture as is implied by the advertisements of
      antibilious pills. To history, to tragedy, to the past, to the future,
      Mrs. Munt remained equally indifferent; hers but to concentrate on the end
      of her journey, and to rescue poor Helen from this dreadful mess.
    </p>
    <p>
      The station for Howards End was at Hilton, one of the large villages that
      are strung so frequently along the North Road, and that owe their size to
      the traffic of coaching and pre-coaching days. Being near London, it had
      not shared in the rural decay, and its long High Street had budded out
      right and left into residential estates. For about a mile a series of
      tiled and slated houses passed before Mrs. Munt&rsquo;s inattentive eyes, a
      series broken at one point by six Danish tumuli that stood shoulder to
      shoulder along the highroad, tombs of soldiers. Beyond these tumuli,
      habitations thickened, and the train came to a standstill in a tangle that
      was almost a town.
    </p>
    <p>
      The station, like the scenery, like Helen&rsquo;s letters, struck an
      indeterminate note. Into which country will it lead, England or Suburbia?
      It was new, it had island platforms and a subway, and the superficial
      comfort exacted by business men. But it held hints of local life, personal
      intercourse, as even Mrs. Munt was to discover.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want a house,&rdquo; she confided to the ticket boy. &ldquo;Its name is Howards
      Lodge. Do you know where it is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Wilcox!&rdquo; the boy called.
    </p>
    <p>
      A young man in front of them turned around.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s wanting Howards End.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing for it but to go forward, though Mrs. Munt was too much
      agitated even to stare at the stranger. But remembering that there were
      two brothers, she had the sense to say to him, &ldquo;Excuse me asking, but are
      you the younger Mr. Wilcox or the elder?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The younger. Can I do anything for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well&rdquo;&mdash;she controlled herself with difficulty. &ldquo;Really. Are you?
      I&mdash;&rdquo; She moved; away from the ticket boy and lowered her voice. &ldquo;I am
      Miss Schlegel&rsquo;s aunt. I ought to introduce myself, oughtn&rsquo;t I? My name is
      Mrs. Munt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was conscious that he raised his cap and said quite coolly, &ldquo;Oh,
      rather; Miss Schlegel is stopping with us. Did you want to see her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Possibly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call you a cab. No; wait a mo&mdash;&rdquo; He thought. &ldquo;Our motor&rsquo;s here.
      I&rsquo;ll run you up in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is very kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all, if you&rsquo;ll just wait till they bring out a parcel from the
      office. This way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My niece is not with you by any chance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I came over with my father. He has gone on north in your train.
      You&rsquo;ll see Miss Schlegel at lunch. You&rsquo;re coming up to lunch, I hope?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to come UP,&rdquo; said Mrs. Munt, not committing herself to
      nourishment until she had studied Helen&rsquo;s lover a little more. He seemed a
      gentleman, but had so rattled her round that her powers of observation
      were numbed. She glanced at him stealthily.
    </p>
    <p>
      To a feminine eye there was nothing amiss in the sharp depressions at the
      corners of his mouth, or in the rather box-like construction of his
      forehead. He was dark, clean-shaven, and seemed accustomed to command.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In front or behind? Which do you prefer? It may be windy in front.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In front if I may; then we can talk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But excuse me one moment&mdash;I can&rsquo;t think what they&rsquo;re doing with that
      parcel.&rdquo; He strode into the booking-office, and called with a new voice:
      &ldquo;Hi! hi, you there! Are you going to keep me waiting all day? Parcel for
      Wilcox, Howards End. Just look sharp!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emerging, he said in quieter tones: &ldquo;This station&rsquo;s abominably organised;
      if I had my way, the whole lot of &rsquo;em should get the sack. May I help you
      in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is very good of you,&rdquo; said Mrs. Munt, as she settled herself into a
      luxurious cavern of red leather, and suffered her person to be padded with
      rugs and shawls. She was more civil than she had intended, but really this
      young man was very kind. Moreover, she was a little afraid of him; his
      self-possession was extraordinary. &ldquo;Very good indeed,&rdquo; she repeated,
      adding: &ldquo;It is just what I should have wished.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good of you to say so,&rdquo; he replied, with a slight look of surprise,
      which, like most slight looks, escaped Mrs. Munt&rsquo;s attention. &ldquo;I was just
      tooling my father over to catch the down train.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, we heard from Helen this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Young Wilcox was pouring in petrol, starting his engine, and performing
      other actions with which this story has no concern. The great car began to
      rock, and the form of Mrs. Munt, trying to explain things, sprang
      agreeably up and down among the red cushions. &ldquo;The mater will be very glad
      to see you,&rdquo; he mumbled. &ldquo;Hi! I say. Parcel. Parcel for Howards End. Bring
      it out. Hi!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A bearded porter emerged with the parcel in one hand and an entry book in
      the other. With the gathering whir of the motor these ejaculations
      mingled: &ldquo;Sign, must I? Why the &mdash; should I sign after all this bother?
      Not even got a pencil on you? Remember next time I report you to the
      station-master. My time&rsquo;s of value, though yours mayn&rsquo;t be. Here&rdquo;&mdash;here
      being a tip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Extremely sorry, Mrs. Munt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all, Mr. Wilcox.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do you object to going through the village? It is rather a longer
      spin, but I have one or two commissions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should love going through the village. Naturally I am very anxious to
      talk things over with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she said this she felt ashamed, for she was disobeying Margaret&rsquo;s
      instructions. Only disobeying them in the letter, surely. Margaret had
      only warned her against discussing the incident with outsiders. Surely it
      was not &ldquo;uncivilised or wrong&rdquo; to discuss it with the young man himself,
      since chance had thrown them together.
    </p>
    <p>
      A reticent fellow, he made no reply. Mounting by her side, he put on
      gloves and spectacles, and off they drove, the bearded porter&mdash;life
      is a mysterious business&mdash;looking after them with admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wind was in their faces down the station road, blowing the dust into
      Mrs. Munt&rsquo;s eyes. But as soon as they turned into the Great North Road she
      opened fire. &ldquo;You can well imagine,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that the news was a great
      shock to us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What news?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Wilcox,&rdquo; she said frankly, &ldquo;Margaret has told me everything&mdash;everything.
      I have seen Helen&rsquo;s letter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He could not look her in the face, as his eyes were fixed on his work; he
      was travelling as quickly as he dared down the High Street. But he
      inclined his head in her direction, and said: &ldquo;I beg your pardon; I didn&rsquo;t
      catch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About Helen. Helen, of course. Helen is a very exceptional person&mdash;I
      am sure you will let me say this, feeling towards her as you do&mdash;indeed,
      all the Schlegels are exceptional. I come in no spirit of interference,
      but it was a great shock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They drew up opposite a draper&rsquo;s. Without replying, he turned round in his
      seat, and contemplated the cloud of dust that they had raised in their
      passage through the village. It was settling again, but not all into the
      road from which he had taken it. Some of it had percolated through the
      open windows, some had whitened the roses and gooseberries of the wayside
      gardens, while a certain proportion had entered the lungs of the
      villagers. &ldquo;I wonder when they&rsquo;ll learn wisdom and tar the roads,&rdquo; was his
      comment. Then a man ran out of the draper&rsquo;s with a roll of oilcloth, and
      off they went again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Margaret could not come herself, on account of poor Tibby, so I am here
      to represent her and to have a good talk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to be so dense,&rdquo; said the young man, again drawing up outside a
      shop. &ldquo;But I still haven&rsquo;t quite understood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Helen, Mr. Wilcox&mdash;my niece and you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He pushed up his goggles and gazed at her, absolutely bewildered. Horror
      smote her to the heart, for even she began to suspect that they were at
      cross-purposes, and that she had commenced her mission by some hideous
      blunder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Schlegel and myself?&rdquo; he asked, compressing his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I trust there has been no misunderstanding,&rdquo; quavered Mrs. Munt. &ldquo;Her
      letter certainly read that way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That you and she&mdash;&rdquo; She paused, then drooped her eyelids.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I catch your meaning,&rdquo; he said stickily. &ldquo;What an extraordinary
      mistake!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you didn&rsquo;t the least&mdash;&rdquo; she stammered, getting blood-red in the
      face, and wishing she had never been born.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Scarcely, as I am already engaged to another lady.&rdquo; There was a moment&rsquo;s
      silence, and then he caught his breath and exploded with, &ldquo;Oh, good God!
      Don&rsquo;t tell me it&rsquo;s some silliness of Paul&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you are Paul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why did you say so at the station?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said nothing of the sort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon, you did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon, I did not. My name is Charles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Younger&rdquo; may mean son as opposed to father, or second brother as opposed
      to first. There is much to be said for either view, and later on they said
      it. But they had other questions before them now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to tell me that Paul&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But she did not like his voice. He sounded as if he was talking to a
      porter, and, certain that he had deceived her at the station, she too grew
      angry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to tell me that Paul and your niece&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Munt&mdash;such is human nature&mdash;determined that she would
      champion the lovers. She was not going to be bullied by a severe young
      man. &ldquo;Yes, they care for one another very much indeed,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I dare
      say they will tell you about it by-and-by. We heard this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Charles clenched his fist and cried, &ldquo;The idiot, the idiot, the little
      fool!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Munt tried to divest herself of her rugs. &ldquo;If that is your attitude,
      Mr. Wilcox, I prefer to walk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg you will do no such thing. I take you up this moment to the house.
      Let me tell you the thing&rsquo;s impossible, and must be stopped.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Munt did not often lose her temper, and when she did it was only to
      protect those whom she loved. On this occasion she blazed out. &ldquo;I quite
      agree, sir. The thing is impossible, and I will come up and stop it. My
      niece is a very exceptional person, and I am not inclined to sit still
      while she throws herself away on those who will not appreciate her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Charles worked his jaws.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Considering she has only known your brother since Wednesday, and only met
      your father and mother at a stray hotel&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could you possibly lower your voice? The shopman will overhear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Esprit de classe&mdash;if one may coin the phrase&mdash;was strong in Mrs.
      Munt. She sat quivering while a member of the lower orders deposited a
      metal funnel, a saucepan, and a garden squirt beside the roll of oilcloth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right behind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo; And the lower orders vanished in a cloud of dust.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I warn you: Paul hasn&rsquo;t a penny; it&rsquo;s useless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No need to warn us, Mr. Wilcox, I assure you. The warning is all the
      other way. My niece has been very foolish, and I shall give her a good
      scolding and take her back to London with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has to make his way out in Nigeria. He couldn&rsquo;t think of marrying for
      years, and when he does it must be a woman who can stand the climate, and
      is in other ways&mdash;Why hasn&rsquo;t he told us? Of course he&rsquo;s ashamed. He
      knows he&rsquo;s been a fool. And so he has&mdash;a downright fool.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She grew furious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whereas Miss Schlegel has lost no time in publishing the news.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I were a man, Mr. Wilcox, for that last remark I&rsquo;d box your ears.
      You&rsquo;re not fit to clean my niece&rsquo;s boots, to sit in the same room with
      her, and you dare&mdash;you actually dare&mdash;I decline to argue with
      such a person.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All I know is, she&rsquo;s spread the thing and he hasn&rsquo;t, and my father&rsquo;s away
      and I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And all that I know is&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Might I finish my sentence, please?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Charles clenched his teeth and sent the motor swerving all over the lane.
    </p>
    <p>
      She screamed.
    </p>
    <p>
      So they played the game of Capping Families, a round of which is always
      played when love would unite two members of our race. But they played it
      with unusual vigour, stating in so many words that Schlegels were better
      than Wilcoxes, Wilcoxes better than Schlegels. They flung decency aside.
      The man was young, the woman deeply stirred; in both a vein of coarseness
      was latent. Their quarrel was no more surprising than are most quarrels&mdash;inevitable
      at the time, incredible afterwards. But it was more than usually futile. A
      few minutes, and they were enlightened. The motor drew up at Howards End,
      and Helen, looking very pale, ran out to meet her aunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aunt Juley, I have just had a telegram from Margaret; I&mdash;I meant to
      stop your coming. It isn&rsquo;t&mdash;it&rsquo;s over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The climax was too much for Mrs. Munt. She burst into tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aunt Juley dear, don&rsquo;t. Don&rsquo;t let them know I&rsquo;ve been so silly. It wasn&rsquo;t
      anything. Do bear up for my sake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Paul,&rdquo; cried Charles Wilcox, pulling his gloves off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let them know. They are never to know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my darling Helen&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Paul! Paul!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A very young man came out of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Paul, is there any truth in this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t&mdash;I don&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes or no, man; plain question, plain answer. Did or didn&rsquo;t Miss Schlegel&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Charles, dear,&rdquo; said a voice from the garden. &ldquo;Charles, dear Charles, one
      doesn&rsquo;t ask plain questions. There aren&rsquo;t such things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were all silent. It was Mrs. Wilcox.
    </p>
    <p>
      She approached just as Helen&rsquo;s letter had described her, trailing
      noiselessly over the lawn, and there was actually a wisp of hay in her
      hands. She seemed to belong not to the young people and their motor, but
      to the house, and to the tree that overshadowed it. One knew that she
      worshipped the past, and that the instinctive wisdom the past can alone
      bestow had descended upon her&mdash;that wisdom to which we give the
      clumsy name of aristocracy. High born she might not be. But assuredly she
      cared about her ancestors, and let them help her. When she saw Charles
      angry, Paul frightened, and Mrs. Munt in tears, she heard her ancestors
      say, &ldquo;Separate those human beings who will hurt each other most. The rest
      can wait.&rdquo; So she did not ask questions. Still less did she pretend that
      nothing had happened, as a competent society hostess would have done. She
      said: &ldquo;Miss Schlegel, would you take your aunt up to your room or to my
      room, whichever you think best. Paul, do find Evie, and tell her lunch for
      six, but I&rsquo;m not sure whether we shall all be downstairs for it.&rdquo; And when
      they had obeyed her, she turned to her elder son, who still stood in the
      throbbing, stinking car, and smiled at him with tenderness, and without
      saying a word, turned away from him towards her flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; he called, &ldquo;are you aware that Paul has been playing the fool
      again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is all right, dear. They have broken off the engagement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Engagement&mdash;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They do not love any longer, if you prefer it put that way,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Wilcox, stooping down to smell a rose.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV
    </h2>
    <p>
      Helen and her aunt returned to Wickham Place in a state of collapse, and
      for a little time Margaret had three invalids on her hands. Mrs. Munt soon
      recovered. She possessed to a remarkable degree the power of distorting
      the past, and before many days were over she had forgotten the part played
      by her own imprudence in the catastrophe. Even at the crisis she had
      cried, &ldquo;Thank goodness, poor Margaret is saved this!&rdquo; which during the
      journey to London evolved into, &ldquo;It had to be gone through by some one,&rdquo;
       which in its turn ripened into the permanent form of &ldquo;The one time I
      really did help Emily&rsquo;s girls was over the Wilcox business.&rdquo; But Helen was
      a more serious patient. New ideas had burst upon her like a thunderclap,
      and by them and by their reverberations she had been stunned.
    </p>
    <p>
      The truth was that she had fallen in love, not with an individual, but
      with a family.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before Paul arrived she had, as it were, been tuned up into his key. The
      energy of the Wilcoxes had fascinated her, had created new images of
      beauty in her responsive mind. To be all day with them in the open air, to
      sleep at night under their roof, had seemed the supreme joy of life, and
      had led to that abandonment of personality that is a possible prelude to
      love. She had liked giving in to Mr. Wilcox, or Evie, or Charles; she had
      liked being told that her notions of life were sheltered or academic; that
      Equality was nonsense, Votes for Women nonsense, Socialism nonsense, Art
      and Literature, except when conducive to strengthening the character,
      nonsense. One by one the Schlegel fetiches had been overthrown, and,
      though professing to defend them, she had rejoiced. When Mr. Wilcox said
      that one sound man of business did more good to the world than a dozen of
      your social reformers, she had swallowed the curious assertion without a
      gasp, and had leant back luxuriously among the cushions of his motorcar.
      When Charles said, &ldquo;Why be so polite to servants? they don&rsquo;t understand
      it,&rdquo; she had not given the Schlegel retort of, &ldquo;If they don&rsquo;t understand
      it, I do.&rdquo; No; she had vowed to be less polite to servants in the future.
      &ldquo;I am swathed in cant,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;and it is good for me to be stripped
      of it.&rdquo; And all that she thought or did or breathed was a quiet
      preparation for Paul. Paul was inevitable. Charles was taken up with
      another girl, Mr. Wilcox was so old, Evie so young, Mrs. Wilcox so
      different. Round the absent brother she began to throw the halo of
      Romance, to irradiate him with all the splendour of those happy days, to
      feel that in him she should draw nearest to the robust ideal. He and she
      were about the same age, Evie said. Most people thought Paul handsomer
      than his brother. He was certainly a better shot, though not so good at
      golf. And when Paul appeared, flushed with the triumph of getting through
      an examination, and ready to flirt with any pretty girl, Helen met him
      halfway, or more than halfway, and turned towards him on the Sunday
      evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had been talking of his approaching exile in Nigeria, and he should
      have continued to talk of it, and allowed their guest to recover. But the
      heave of her bosom flattered him. Passion was possible, and he became
      passionate. Deep down in him something whispered, &ldquo;This girl would let you
      kiss her; you might not have such a chance again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was &ldquo;how it happened,&rdquo; or, rather, how Helen described it to her
      sister, using words even more unsympathetic than my own. But the poetry of
      that kiss, the wonder of it, the magic that there was in life for hours
      after it&mdash;who can describe that? It is so easy for an Englishman to
      sneer at these chance collisions of human beings. To the insular cynic and
      the insular moralist they offer an equal opportunity. It is so easy to
      talk of &ldquo;passing emotion,&rdquo; and to forget how vivid the emotion was ere it
      passed. Our impulse to sneer, to forget, is at root a good one. We
      recognise that emotion is not enough, and that men and women are
      personalities capable of sustained relations, not mere opportunities for
      an electrical discharge. Yet we rate the impulse too highly. We do not
      admit that by collisions of this trivial sort the doors of heaven may be
      shaken open. To Helen, at all events, her life was to bring nothing more
      intense than the embrace of this boy who played no part in it. He had
      drawn her out of the house, where there was danger of surprise and light;
      he had led her by a path he knew, until they stood under the column of the
      vast wych-elm. A man in the darkness, he had whispered &ldquo;I love you&rdquo; when
      she was desiring love. In time his slender personality faded, the scene
      that he had evoked endured. In all the variable years that followed she
      never saw the like of it again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; said Margaret&mdash; &ldquo;at least, I understand as much as
      ever is understood of these things. Tell me now what happened on the
      Monday morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was over at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How, Helen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was still happy while I dressed, but as I came downstairs I got
      nervous, and when I went into the dining-room I knew it was no good. There
      was Evie&mdash;I can&rsquo;t explain&mdash;managing the tea-urn, and Mr. Wilcox
      reading the Times.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was Paul there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; and Charles was talking to him about stocks and shares, and he
      looked frightened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By slight indications the sisters could convey much to each other.
      Margaret saw horror latent in the scene, and Helen&rsquo;s next remark did not
      surprise her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somehow, when that kind of man looks frightened it is too awful. It is
      all right for us to be frightened, or for men of another sort&mdash;father,
      for instance; but for men like that! When I saw all the others so placid,
      and Paul mad with terror in case I said the wrong thing, I felt for a
      moment that the whole Wilcox family was a fraud, just a wall of newspapers
      and motor-cars and golf-clubs, and that if it fell I should find nothing
      behind it but panic and emptiness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that. The Wilcoxes struck me as being genuine people,
      particularly the wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t really think that. But Paul was so broad-shouldered; all
      kinds of extraordinary things made it worse, and I knew that it would
      never do&mdash;never. I said to him after breakfast, when the others were
      practising strokes, &lsquo;We rather lost our heads,&rsquo; and he looked better at
      once, though frightfully ashamed. He began a speech about having no money
      to marry on, but it hurt him to make it, and I stopped him. Then he said,
      &lsquo;I must beg your pardon over this, Miss Schlegel; I can&rsquo;t think what came
      over me last night.&rsquo; And I said, &lsquo;Nor what over me; never mind.&rsquo; And then
      we parted&mdash;at least, until I remembered that I had written straight
      off to tell you the night before, and that frightened him again. I asked
      him to send a telegram for me, for he knew you would be coming or
      something; and he tried to get hold of the motor, but Charles and Mr.
      Wilcox wanted it to go to the station; and Charles offered to send the
      telegram for me, and then I had to say that the telegram was of no
      consequence, for Paul said Charles might read it, and though I wrote it
      out several times, he always said people would suspect something. He took
      it himself at last, pretending that he must walk down to get cartridges,
      and, what with one thing and the other, it was not handed in at the
      post-office until too late. It was the most terrible morning. Paul
      disliked me more and more, and Evie talked cricket averages till I nearly
      screamed. I cannot think how I stood her all the other days. At last
      Charles and his father started for the station, and then came your
      telegram warning me that Aunt Juley was coming by that train, and Paul&mdash;oh,
      rather horrible&mdash;said that I had muddled it. But Mrs. Wilcox knew.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Knew what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything; though we neither of us told her a word, and she had known
      all along, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, she must have overheard you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose so, but it seemed wonderful. When Charles and Aunt Juley drove
      up, calling each other names, Mrs. Wilcox stepped in from the garden and
      made everything less terrible. Ugh! but it has been a disgusting business.
      To think that&mdash;&rdquo; She sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To think that because you and a young man meet for a moment, there must
      be all these telegrams and anger,&rdquo; supplied Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve often thought about it, Helen. It&rsquo;s one of the most interesting
      things in the world. The truth is that there is a great outer life that
      you and I have never touched&mdash;a life in which telegrams and anger
      count. Personal relations, that we think supreme, are not supreme there.
      There love means marriage settlements, death, death duties. So far I&rsquo;m
      clear. But here my difficulty. This outer life, though obviously horrid;
      often seems the real one&mdash;there&rsquo;s grit in it. It does breed
      character. Do personal relations lead to sloppiness in the end?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Meg&mdash;, that&rsquo;s what I felt, only not so clearly, when the
      Wilcoxes were so competent, and seemed to have their hands on all the
      ropes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you feel it now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember Paul at breakfast,&rdquo; said Helen quietly. &ldquo;I shall never forget
      him. He had nothing to fall back upon. I know that personal relations are
      the real life, for ever and ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Amen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So the Wilcox episode fell into the background, leaving behind it memories
      of sweetness and horror that mingled, and the sisters pursued the life
      that Helen had commended. They talked to each other and to other people,
      they filled the tall thin house at Wickham Place with those whom they
      liked or could befriend. They even attended public meetings. In their own
      fashion they cared deeply about politics, though not as politicians would
      have us care; they desired that public life should mirror whatever is good
      in the life within. Temperance, tolerance, and sexual equality were
      intelligible cries to them; whereas they did not follow our Forward Policy
      in Tibet with the keen attention that it merits, and would at times
      dismiss the whole British Empire with a puzzled, if reverent, sigh. Not
      out of them are the shows of history erected: the world would be a grey,
      bloodless place were it composed entirely of Miss Schlegels. But the world
      being what it is, perhaps they shine out in it like stars.
    </p>
    <p>
      A word on their origin. They were not &ldquo;English to the back-bone,&rdquo; as their
      aunt had piously asserted. But, on the other hand, they were not &ldquo;Germans
      of the dreadful sort.&rdquo; Their father had belonged to a type that was more
      prominent in Germany fifty years ago than now. He was not the aggressive
      German, so dear to the English journalist, nor the domestic German, so
      dear to the English wit. If one classed him at all it would be as the
      countryman of Hegel and Kant, as the idealist, inclined to be dreamy,
      whose Imperialism was the Imperialism of the air. Not that his life had
      been inactive. He had fought like blazes against Denmark, Austria, France.
      But he had fought without visualising the results of victory. A hint of
      the truth broke on him after Sedan, when he saw the dyed moustaches of
      Napoleon going grey; another when he entered Paris, and saw the smashed
      windows of the Tuileries. Peace came&mdash;it was all very immense, one
      had turned into an Empire&mdash;but he knew that some quality had vanished
      for which not all Alsace-Lorraine could compensate him. Germany a
      commercial Power, Germany a naval Power, Germany with colonies here and a
      Forward Policy there, and legitimate aspirations in the other place, might
      appeal to others, and be fitly served by them; for his own part, he
      abstained from the fruits of victory, and naturalised himself in England.
      The more earnest members of his family never forgave him, and knew that
      his children, though scarcely English of the dreadful sort, would never be
      German to the back-bone. He had obtained work in one of our provincial
      universities, and there married Poor Emily (or Die Englanderin, as the
      case may be), and as she had money, they proceeded to London, and came to
      know a good many people. But his gaze was always fixed beyond the sea. It
      was his hope that the clouds of materialism obscuring the Fatherland would
      part in time, and the mild intellectual light re-emerge. &ldquo;Do you imply
      that we Germans are stupid, Uncle Ernst?&rdquo; exclaimed a haughty and
      magnificent nephew. Uncle Ernst replied, &ldquo;To my mind. You use the
      intellect, but you no longer care about it. That I call stupidity.&rdquo; As the
      haughty nephew did not follow, he continued, &ldquo;You only care about the
      things that you can use, and therefore arrange them in the following
      order: Money, supremely useful; intellect, rather useful; imagination, of
      no use at all. No&rdquo;&mdash;for the other had protested&mdash;&ldquo;your
      Pan-Germanism is no more imaginative than is our Imperialism over here. It
      is the vice of a vulgar mind to be thrilled by bigness, to think that a
      thousand square miles are a thousand times more wonderful than one square
      mile, and that a million square miles are almost the same as heaven. That
      is not imagination. No, it kills it. When their poets over here try to
      celebrate bigness they are dead at once, and naturally. Your poets too are
      dying, your philosophers, your musicians, to whom Europe has listened for
      two hundred years. Gone. Gone with the little courts that nurtured them&mdash;gone
      with Esterhazy and Weimar. What? What&rsquo;s that? Your universities? Oh yes,
      you have learned men, who collect more facts than do the learned men of
      England. They collect facts, and facts, and empires of facts. But which of
      them will rekindle the light within?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To all this Margaret listened, sitting on the haughty nephew&rsquo;s knee.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a unique education for the little girls. The haughty nephew would
      be at Wickham Place one day, bringing with him an even haughtier wife,
      both convinced that Germany was appointed by God to govern the world. Aunt
      Juley would come the next day, convinced that Great Britain had been
      appointed to the same post by the same authority. Were both these
      loud-voiced parties right? On one occasion they had met and Margaret with
      clasped hands had implored them to argue the subject out in her presence.
      Whereat they blushed, and began to talk about the weather. &ldquo;Papa,&rdquo; she
      cried&mdash;she was a most offensive child&mdash;&ldquo;why will they not
      discuss this most clear question?&rdquo; Her father, surveying the parties
      grimly, replied that he did not know. Putting her head on one side,
      Margaret then remarked, &ldquo;To me one of two things is very clear; either God
      does not know his own mind about England and Germany, or else these do not
      know the mind of God.&rdquo; A hateful little girl, but at thirteen she had
      grasped a dilemma that most people travel through life without perceiving.
      Her brain darted up and down; it grew pliant and strong. Her conclusion
      was, that any human being lies nearer to the unseen than any organisation,
      and from this she never varied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen advanced along the same lines, though with a more irresponsible
      tread. In character she resembled her sister, but she was pretty, and so
      apt to have a more amusing time. People gathered round her more readily,
      especially when they were new acquaintances, and she did enjoy a little
      homage very much. When their father died and they ruled alone at Wickham
      Place, she often absorbed the whole of the company, while Margaret&mdash;both
      were tremendous talkers&mdash;fell flat. Neither sister bothered about
      this. Helen never apologised afterwards, Margaret did not feel the
      slightest rancour. But looks have their influence upon character. The
      sisters were alike as little girls, but at the time of the Wilcox episode
      their methods were beginning to diverge; the younger was rather apt to
      entice people, and, in enticing them, to be herself enticed; the elder
      went straight ahead, and accepted an occasional failure as part of the
      game.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little need be premised about Tibby. He was now an intelligent man of
      sixteen, but dyspeptic and difficile.

      CHAPTER V
    </h2>
    <p>
      It will be generally admitted that Beethoven&rsquo;s Fifth Symphony is the most
      sublime noise that has ever penetrated into the ear of man. All sorts and
      conditions are satisfied by it. Whether you are like Mrs. Munt, and tap
      surreptitiously when the tunes come&mdash;of course, not so as to disturb
      the others&mdash;or like Helen, who can see heroes and shipwrecks in the
      music&rsquo;s flood; or like Margaret, who can only see the music; or like
      Tibby, who is profoundly versed in counterpoint, and holds the full score
      open on his knee; or like their cousin, Fraulein Mosebach, who remembers
      all the time that Beethoven is echt Deutsch; or like Fraulein Mosebach&rsquo;s
      young man, who can remember nothing but Fraulein Mosebach: in any case,
      the passion of your life becomes more vivid, and you are bound to admit
      that such a noise is cheap at two shillings. It is cheap, even if you hear
      it in the Queen&rsquo;s Hall, dreariest music-room in London, though not as
      dreary as the Free Trade Hall, Manchester; and even if you sit on the
      extreme left of that hall, so that the brass bumps at you before the rest
      of the orchestra arrives, it is still cheap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whom is Margaret talking to?&rdquo; said Mrs. Munt, at the conclusion of the
      first movement. She was again in London on a visit to Wickham Place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen looked down the long line of their party, and said that she did not
      know.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would it be some young man or other whom she takes an interest in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I expect so,&rdquo; Helen replied. Music enwrapped her, and she could not enter
      into the distinction that divides young men whom one takes an interest in
      from young men whom one knows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You girls are so wonderful in always having&mdash;Oh dear! one mustn&rsquo;t
      talk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For the Andante had begun&mdash;very beautiful, but bearing a family
      likeness to all the other beautiful Andantes that Beethoven had written,
      and, to Helen&rsquo;s mind, rather disconnecting the heroes and shipwrecks of
      the first movement from the heroes and goblins of the third. She heard the
      tune through once, and then her attention wandered, and she gazed at the
      audience, or the organ, or the architecture. Much did she censure the
      attenuated Cupids who encircle the ceiling of the Queen&rsquo;s Hall, inclining
      each to each with vapid gesture, and clad in sallow pantaloons, on which
      the October sunlight struck. &ldquo;How awful to marry a man like those Cupids!&rdquo;
       thought Helen. Here Beethoven started decorating his tune, so she heard
      him through once more, and then she smiled at her Cousin Frieda. But
      Frieda, listening to Classical Music, could not respond. Herr Liesecke,
      too, looked as if wild horses could not make him inattentive; there were
      lines across his forehead, his lips were parted, his pince-nez at right
      angles to his nose, and he had laid a thick, white hand on either knee.
      And next to her was Aunt Juley, so British, and wanting to tap. How
      interesting that row of people was! What diverse influences had gone to
      the making! Here Beethoven, after humming and hawing with great sweetness,
      said &ldquo;Heigho,&rdquo; and the Andante came to an end. Applause, and a round of
      &ldquo;wunderschoning&rdquo; and pracht volleying from the German contingent. Margaret
      started talking to her new young man; Helen said to her aunt: &ldquo;Now comes
      the wonderful movement: first of all the goblins, and then a trio of
      elephants dancing&rdquo;; and Tibby implored the company generally to look out
      for the transitional passage on the drum.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the what, dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the drum, Aunt Juley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; look out for the part where you think you have done with the goblins
      and they come back,&rdquo; breathed Helen, as the music started with a goblin
      walking quietly over the universe, from end to end. Others followed him.
      They were not aggressive creatures; it was that that made them so terrible
      to Helen. They merely observed in passing that there was no such thing as
      splendour or heroism in the world. After the interlude of elephants
      dancing, they returned and made the observation for the second time. Helen
      could not contradict them, for, once at all events, she had felt the same,
      and had seen the reliable walls of youth collapse. Panic and emptiness!
      Panic and emptiness! The goblins were right. Her brother raised his
      finger; it was the transitional passage on the drum.
    </p>
    <p>
      For, as if things were going too far, Beethoven took hold of the goblins
      and made them do what he wanted. He appeared in person. He gave them a
      little push, and they began to walk in a major key instead of in a minor,
      and then&mdash;he blew with his mouth and they were scattered! Gusts of
      splendour, gods and demigods contending with vast swords, colour and
      fragrance broadcast on the field of battle, magnificent victory,
      magnificent death! Oh, it all burst before the girl, and she even
      stretched out her gloved hands as if it was tangible. Any fate was
      titanic; any contest desirable; conqueror and conquered would alike be
      applauded by the angels of the utmost stars.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the goblins&mdash;they had not really been there at all? They were
      only the phantoms of cowardice and unbelief? One healthy human impulse
      would dispel them? Men like the Wilcoxes, or ex-President Roosevelt, would
      say yes. Beethoven knew better. The goblins really had been there. They
      might return&mdash;and they did. It was as if the splendour of life might
      boil over and waste to steam and froth. In its dissolution one heard the
      terrible, ominous note, and a goblin, with increased malignity, walked
      quietly over the universe from end to end. Panic and emptiness! Panic and
      emptiness! Even the flaming ramparts of the world might fall. Beethoven
      chose to make all right in the end. He built the ramparts up. He blew with
      his mouth for the second time, and again the goblins were scattered. He
      brought back the gusts of splendour, the heroism, the youth, the
      magnificence of life and of death, and, amid vast roarings of a superhuman
      joy, he led his Fifth Symphony to its conclusion. But the goblins were
      there. They could return. He had said so bravely, and that is why one can
      trust Beethoven when he says other things.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen pushed her way out during the applause. She desired to be alone. The
      music had summed up to her all that had happened or could happen in her
      career.
    </p>
    <p>
      She read it as a tangible statement, which could never be superseded. The
      notes meant this and that to her, and they could have no other meaning,
      and life could have no other meaning. She pushed right out of the building
      and walked slowly down the outside staircase, breathing the autumnal air,
      and then she strolled home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Margaret,&rdquo; called Mrs. Munt, &ldquo;is Helen all right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is always going away in the middle of a programme,&rdquo; said Tibby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The music has evidently moved her deeply,&rdquo; said Fraulein Mosebach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; said Margaret&rsquo;s young man, who had for some time been
      preparing a sentence, &ldquo;but that lady has, quite inadvertently, taken my
      umbrella.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, good gracious me!&mdash;I am so sorry. Tibby, run after Helen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall miss the Four Serious Songs if I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tibby, love, you must go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t of any consequence,&rdquo; said the young man, in truth a little
      uneasy about his umbrella.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But of course it is. Tibby! Tibby!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tibby rose to his feet, and wilfully caught his person on the backs of the
      chairs. By the time he had tipped up the seat and had found his hat, and
      had deposited his full score in safety, it was &ldquo;too late&rdquo; to go after
      Helen. The Four Serious Songs had begun, and one could not move during
      their performance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My sister is so careless,&rdquo; whispered Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; replied the young man; but his voice was dead and cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you would give me your address&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, not at all, not at all;&rdquo; and he wrapped his greatcoat over his knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the Four Serious Songs rang shallow in Margaret&rsquo;s ears. Brahms, for
      all his grumbling and grizzling, had never guessed what it felt like to be
      suspected of stealing an umbrella. For this fool of a young man thought
      that she and Helen and Tibby had been playing the confidence trick on him,
      and that if he gave his address they would break into his rooms some
      midnight or other and steal his walking-stick too. Most ladies would have
      laughed, but Margaret really minded, for it gave her a glimpse into
      squalor. To trust people is a luxury in which only the wealthy can
      indulge; the poor cannot afford it. As soon as Brahms had grunted himself
      out, she gave him her card and said, &ldquo;That is where we live; if you
      preferred, you could call for the umbrella after the concert, but I didn&rsquo;t
      like to trouble you when it has all been our fault.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His face brightened a little when he saw that Wickham Place was W. It was
      sad to see him corroded with suspicion, and yet not daring to be impolite,
      in case these well-dressed people were honest after all. She took it as a
      good sign that he said to her, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fine programme this afternoon, is
      it not?&rdquo; for this was the remark with which he had originally opened,
      before the umbrella intervened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Beethoven&rsquo;s fine,&rdquo; said Margaret, who was not a female of the
      encouraging type. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like the Brahms, though, nor the Mendelssohn
      that came first and ugh! I don&rsquo;t like this Elgar that&rsquo;s coming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, what?&rdquo; called Herr Liesecke, overhearing. &ldquo;The &lsquo;Pomp and
      Circumstance&rsquo; will not be fine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Margaret, you tiresome girl!&rdquo; cried her aunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here have I been persuading Herr Liesecke to stop for &lsquo;Pomp and
      Circumstance,&rsquo; and you are undoing all my work. I am so anxious for him to
      hear what WE are doing in music. Oh,&mdash;you musn&rsquo;t run down our English
      composers, Margaret.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For my part, I have heard the composition at Stettin,&rdquo; said Fraulein
      Mosebach, &ldquo;on two occasions. It is dramatic, a little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Frieda, you despise English music. You know you do. And English art. And
      English literature, except Shakespeare, and he&rsquo;s a German. Very well,
      Frieda, you may go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lovers laughed and glanced at each other. Moved by a common impulse,
      they rose to their feet and fled from &ldquo;Pomp and Circumstance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have this call to pay in Finsbury Circus, it is true,&rdquo; said Herr
      Liesecke, as he edged past her and reached the gangway just as the music
      started.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Margaret&mdash;&rdquo; loudly whispered by Aunt Juley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Margaret, Margaret! Fraulein Mosebach has left her beautiful little bag
      behind her on the seat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sure enough, there was Frieda&rsquo;s reticule, containing her address book, her
      pocket dictionary, her map of London, and her money.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, what a bother&mdash;what a family we are! Fr&mdash;frieda!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; said all those who thought the music fine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s the number they want in Finsbury Circus.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Might I&mdash;couldn&rsquo;t I&mdash;&rdquo; said the suspicious young man, and got
      very red.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I would be so grateful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took the bag&mdash;money clinking inside it&mdash;and slipped up the
      gangway with it. He was just in time to catch them at the swing-door, and
      he received a pretty smile from the German girl and a fine bow from her
      cavalier. He returned to his seat upsides with the world. The trust that
      they had reposed in him was trivial, but he felt that it cancelled his
      mistrust for them, and that probably he would not be &ldquo;had&rdquo; over his
      umbrella. This young man had been &ldquo;had&rdquo; in the past badly, perhaps
      overwhelmingly&mdash;and now most of his energies went in defending
      himself against the unknown. But this afternoon&mdash;perhaps on account
      of music&mdash;he perceived that one must slack off occasionally or what
      is the good of being alive? Wickham Place, W., though a risk, was as safe
      as most things, and he would risk it.
    </p>
    <p>
      So when the concert was over and Margaret said, &ldquo;We live quite near; I am
      going there now. Could you walk round with me, and we&rsquo;ll find your
      umbrella?&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; peaceably, and followed her out of the
      Queen&rsquo;s Hall. She wished that he was not so anxious to hand a lady
      downstairs, or to carry a lady&rsquo;s programme for her&mdash;his class was
      near enough her own for its manners to vex her. But she found him
      interesting on the whole&mdash;every one interested the Schlegels on the
      whole at that time&mdash;and while her lips talked culture, her heart was
      planning to invite him to tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How tired one gets after music!&rdquo; she began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you find the atmosphere of Queen&rsquo;s Hall oppressive?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, horribly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But surely the atmosphere of Covent Garden is even more oppressive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you go there much?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When my work permits, I attend the gallery for the Royal Opera.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen would have exclaimed, &ldquo;So do I. I love the gallery,&rdquo; and thus have
      endeared herself to the young man. Helen could do these things. But
      Margaret had an almost morbid horror of &ldquo;drawing people out,&rdquo; of &ldquo;making
      things go.&rdquo; She had been to the gallery at Covent Garden, but she did not
      &ldquo;attend&rdquo; it, preferring the more expensive seats; still less did she love
      it. So she made no reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This year I have been three times&mdash;to &lsquo;Faust,&rsquo; &lsquo;Tosca,&rsquo; and&mdash;&rdquo;
       Was it &ldquo;Tannhouser&rdquo; or &ldquo;Tannhoyser&rdquo;? Better not risk the word.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret disliked &ldquo;Tosca&rdquo; and &ldquo;Faust.&rdquo; And so, for one reason and another,
      they walked on in silence, chaperoned by the voice of Mrs. Munt, who was
      getting into difficulties with her nephew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do in a WAY remember the passage, Tibby, but when every instrument is
      so beautiful, it is difficult to pick out one thing rather than another. I
      am sure that you and Helen take me to the very nicest concerts. Not a dull
      note from beginning to end. I only wish that our German friends had stayed
      till it finished.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But surely you haven&rsquo;t forgotten the drum steadily beating on the low C,
      Aunt Juley?&rdquo; came Tibby&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;No one could. It&rsquo;s unmistakable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A specially loud part?&rdquo; hazarded Mrs. Munt. &ldquo;Of course I do not go in for
      being musical,&rdquo; she added, the shot failing. &ldquo;I only care for music&mdash;a
      very different thing. But still I will say this for myself&mdash;I do know
      when I like a thing and when I don&rsquo;t. Some people are the same about
      pictures. They can go into a picture gallery&mdash;Miss Conder can&mdash;and
      say straight off what they feel, all round the wall. I never could do
      that. But music is so different from pictures, to my mind. When it comes
      to music I am as safe as houses, and I assure you, Tibby, I am by no means
      pleased by everything. There was a thing&mdash;something about a faun in
      French&mdash;which Helen went into ecstasies over, but I thought it most
      tinkling and superficial, and said so, and I held to my opinion too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you agree?&rdquo; asked Margaret. &ldquo;Do you think music is so different from
      pictures?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I should have thought so, kind of,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So should I. Now, my sister declares they&rsquo;re just the same. We have great
      arguments over it. She says I&rsquo;m dense; I say she&rsquo;s sloppy.&rdquo; Getting under
      way, she cried: &ldquo;Now, doesn&rsquo;t it seem absurd to you? What is the good of
      the Arts if they&rsquo;re interchangeable? What is the good of the ear if it
      tells you the same as the eye? Helen&rsquo;s one aim is to translate tunes into
      the language of painting, and pictures into the language of music. It&rsquo;s
      very ingenious, and she says several pretty things in the process, but
      what&rsquo;s gained, I&rsquo;d like to know? Oh, it&rsquo;s all rubbish, radically false. If
      Monet&rsquo;s really Debussy, and Debussy&rsquo;s really Monet, neither gentleman is
      worth his salt&mdash;that&rsquo;s my opinion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Evidently these sisters quarrelled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, this very symphony that we&rsquo;ve just been having&mdash;she won&rsquo;t let
      it alone. She labels it with meanings from start to finish; turns it into
      literature. I wonder if the day will ever return when music will be
      treated as music. Yet I don&rsquo;t know. There&rsquo;s my brother&mdash;behind us. He
      treats music as music, and oh, my goodness! He makes me angrier than any
      one, simply furious. With him I daren&rsquo;t even argue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An unhappy family, if talented.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, of course, the real villain is Wagner. He has done more than any man
      in the nineteenth century towards the muddling of the arts. I do feel that
      music is in a very serious state just now, though extraordinarily
      interesting. Every now and then in history there do come these terrible
      geniuses, like Wagner, who stir up all the wells of thought at once. For a
      moment it&rsquo;s splendid. Such a splash as never was. But afterwards&mdash;such
      a lot of mud; and the wells&mdash;as it were, they communicate with each
      other too easily now, and not one of them will run quite clear. That&rsquo;s
      what Wagner&rsquo;s done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her speeches fluttered away from the young man like birds. If only he
      could talk like this, he would have caught the world. Oh, to acquire
      culture! Oh, to pronounce foreign names correctly! Oh, to be well
      informed, discoursing at ease on every subject that a lady started! But it
      would take one years. With an hour at lunch and a few shattered hours in
      the evening, how was it possible to catch up with leisured women, who had
      been reading steadily from childhood? His brain might be full of names, he
      might have even heard of Monet and Debussy; the trouble was that he could
      not string them together into a sentence, he could not make them &ldquo;tell,&rdquo;
       he could not quite forget about his stolen umbrella. Yes, the umbrella was
      the real trouble. Behind Monet and Debussy the umbrella persisted, with
      the steady beat of a drum. &ldquo;I suppose my umbrella will be all right,&rdquo; he
      was thinking. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t really mind about it. I will think about music
      instead. I suppose my umbrella will be all right.&rdquo; Earlier in the
      afternoon he had worried about seats. Ought he to have paid as much as two
      shillings? Earlier still he had wondered, &ldquo;Shall I try to do without a
      programme?&rdquo; There had always been something to worry him ever since he
      could remember, always something that distracted him in the pursuit of
      beauty. For he did pursue beauty, and, therefore, Margaret&rsquo;s speeches did
      flutter away from him like birds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret talked ahead, occasionally saying, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think so? don&rsquo;t you
      feel the same?&rdquo; And once she stopped, and said, &ldquo;Oh, do interrupt me!&rdquo;
       which terrified him. She did not attract him, though she filled him with
      awe. Her figure was meagre, her face seemed all teeth and eyes, her
      references to her sister and her brother were uncharitable. For all her
      cleverness and culture, she was probably one of those soulless,
      atheistical women who have been so shown up by Miss Corelli. It was
      surprising (and alarming) that she should suddenly say, &ldquo;I do hope that
      you&rsquo;ll come in and have some tea. We should be so glad. I have dragged you
      so far out of your way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They had arrived at Wickham Place. The sun had set, and the backwater, in
      deep shadow, was filling with a gentle haze. To the right the fantastic
      sky-line of the flats towered black against the hues of evening; to the
      left the older houses raised a square-cut, irregular parapet against the
      grey. Margaret fumbled for her latch-key. Of course she had forgotten it.
      So, grasping her umbrella by its ferrule, she leant over the area and
      tapped at the dining-room window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Helen! Let us in!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said a voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been taking this gentleman&rsquo;s umbrella.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Taken a what?&rdquo; said Helen, opening the door. &ldquo;Oh, what&rsquo;s that? Do come
      in! How do you do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Helen, you must not be so ramshackly. You took this gentleman&rsquo;s umbrella
      away from Queen&rsquo;s Hall, and he has had the trouble of coming round for
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I am so sorry!&rdquo; cried Helen, all her hair flying. She had pulled off
      her hat as soon as she returned, and had flung herself into the big
      dining-room chair. &ldquo;I do nothing but steal umbrellas. I am so very sorry!
      Do come in and choose one. Is yours a hooky or a nobbly? Mine&rsquo;s a nobbly&mdash;at
      least, I THINK it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The light was turned on, and they began to search the hall, Helen, who had
      abruptly parted with the Fifth Symphony, commenting with shrill little
      cries.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you talk, Meg! You stole an old gentleman&rsquo;s silk top-hat. Yes, she
      did, Aunt Juley. It is a positive fact. She thought it was a muff. Oh,
      heavens! I&rsquo;ve knocked the In-and-Out card down. Where&rsquo;s Frieda? Tibby, why
      don&rsquo;t you ever&mdash;No, I can&rsquo;t remember what I was going to say. That
      wasn&rsquo;t it, but do tell the maids to hurry tea up. What about this
      umbrella?&rdquo; She opened it. &ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s all gone along the seams. It&rsquo;s an
      appalling umbrella. It must be mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But it was not.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took it from her, murmured a few words of thanks, and then fled, with
      the lilting step of the clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if you will stop&mdash;&rdquo; cried Margaret. &ldquo;Now, Helen, how stupid
      you&rsquo;ve been!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whatever have I done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see that you&rsquo;ve frightened him away? I meant him to stop to
      tea. You oughtn&rsquo;t to talk about stealing or holes in an umbrella. I saw
      his nice eyes getting so miserable. No, it&rsquo;s not a bit of good now.&rdquo; For
      Helen had darted out into the street, shouting, &ldquo;Oh, do stop!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say it is all for the best,&rdquo; opined Mrs. Munt. &ldquo;We know nothing
      about the young man, Margaret, and your drawing-room is full of very
      tempting little things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Helen cried: &ldquo;Aunt Juley, how can you! You make me more and more
      ashamed. I&rsquo;d rather he had been a thief and taken all the apostle spoons
      than that I&mdash;Well, I must shut the front-door, I suppose. One more
      failure for Helen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I think the apostle spoons could have gone as rent,&rdquo; said Margaret.
      Seeing that her aunt did not understand, she added: &ldquo;You remember &lsquo;rent&rsquo;?
      It was one of father&rsquo;s words&mdash;Rent to the ideal, to his own faith in
      human nature. You remember how he would trust strangers, and if they
      fooled him he would say, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s better to be fooled than to be suspicious&rsquo;&mdash;that
      the confidence trick is the work of man, but the want-of-confidence trick
      is the work of the devil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember something of the sort now,&rdquo; said Mrs. Munt, rather tartly, for
      she longed to add, &ldquo;It was lucky that your father married a wife with
      money.&rdquo; But this was unkind, and she contented herself with, &ldquo;Why, he
      might have stolen the little Ricketts picture as well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better that he had,&rdquo; said Helen stoutly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I agree with Aunt Juley,&rdquo; said Margaret. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather mistrust people
      than lose my little Ricketts. There are limits.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Their brother, finding the incident commonplace, had stolen upstairs to
      see whether there were scones for tea. He warmed the teapot&mdash;almost
      too deftly&mdash;rejected the orange pekoe that the parlour-maid had
      provided, poured in five spoonfuls of a superior blend, filled up with
      really boiling water, and now called to the ladies to be quick or they
      would lose the aroma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Auntie Tibby,&rdquo; called Helen, while Margaret, thoughtful again,
      said: &ldquo;In a way, I wish we had a real boy in the house&mdash;the kind of
      boy who cares for men. It would make entertaining so much easier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; said her sister. &ldquo;Tibby only cares for cultured females singing
      Brahms.&rdquo; And when they joined him she said rather sharply: &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you
      make that young man welcome, Tibby? You must do the host a little, you
      know. You ought to have taken his hat and coaxed him into stopping,
      instead of letting him be swamped by screaming women.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tibby sighed, and drew a long strand of hair over his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s no good looking superior. I mean what I say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave Tibby alone!&rdquo; said Margaret, who could not bear her brother to be
      scolded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the house a regular hen-coop!&rdquo; grumbled Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my dear!&rdquo; protested Mrs. Munt. &ldquo;How can you say such dreadful things!
      The number of men you get here has always astonished me. If there is any
      danger it&rsquo;s the other way round.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but it&rsquo;s the wrong sort of men, Helen means.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; corrected Helen. &ldquo;We get the right sort of man, but the
      wrong side of him, and I say that&rsquo;s Tibby&rsquo;s fault. There ought to be a
      something about the house&mdash;an&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know what.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A touch of the W&rsquo;s, perhaps?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen put out her tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are the W&rsquo;s?&rdquo; asked Tibby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The W&rsquo;s are things I and Meg and Aunt Juley know about and you don&rsquo;t, so
      there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose that ours is a female house,&rdquo; said Margaret, &ldquo;and one must just
      accept it. No, Aunt Juley, I don&rsquo;t mean that this house is full of women.
      I am trying to say something much more clever. I mean that it was
      irrevocably feminine, even in father&rsquo;s time. Now I&rsquo;m sure you understand!
      Well, I&rsquo;ll give you another example. It&rsquo;ll shock you, but I don&rsquo;t care.
      Suppose Queen Victoria gave a dinner-party, and that the guests had been
      Leighton, Millais, Swinburne, Rossetti, Meredith, Fitzgerald, etc. Do you
      suppose that the atmosphere of that dinner would have been artistic?
      Heavens, no! The very chairs on which they sat would have seen to that. So
      with our house&mdash;it must be feminine, and all we can do is to see that
      it isn&rsquo;t effeminate. Just as another house that I can mention, but won&rsquo;t,
      sounded irrevocably masculine, and all its inmates can do is to see that
      it isn&rsquo;t brutal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That house being the W&rsquo;s house, I presume,&rdquo; said Tibby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going to be told about the W&rsquo;s, my child,&rdquo; Helen cried, &ldquo;so
      don&rsquo;t you think it. And on the other hand, I don&rsquo;t the least mind if you
      find out, so don&rsquo;t you think you&rsquo;ve done anything clever, in either case.
      Give me a cigarette.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do what you can for the house,&rdquo; said Margaret. &ldquo;The drawing-room
      reeks of smoke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you smoked too, the house might suddenly turn masculine. Atmosphere is
      probably a question of touch and go. Even at Queen Victoria&rsquo;s dinner-party&mdash;if
      something had been just a little Different&mdash;perhaps if she&rsquo;d worn a
      clinging Liberty tea-gown instead of a magenta satin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With an India shawl over her shoulders&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fastened at the bosom with a Cairngorm-pin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bursts of disloyal laughter&mdash;you must remember that they are half
      German&mdash;greeted these suggestions, and Margaret said pensively, &ldquo;How
      inconceivable it would be if the Royal Family cared about Art.&rdquo; And the
      conversation drifted away and away, and Helen&rsquo;s cigarette turned to a spot
      in the darkness, and the great flats opposite were sown with lighted
      windows which vanished and were relit again, and vanished incessantly.
      Beyond them the thoroughfare roared gently&mdash;a tide that could never
      be quiet, while in the east, invisible behind the smokes of Wapping, the
      moon was rising.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That reminds me, Margaret. We might have taken that young man into the
      dining-room, at all events. Only the majolica plate&mdash;and that is so
      firmly set in the wall. I am really distressed that he had no tea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For that little incident had impressed the three women more than might be
      supposed. It remained as a goblin footfall, as a hint that all is not for
      the best in the best of all possible worlds, and that beneath these
      superstructures of wealth and art there wanders an ill-fed boy, who has
      recovered his umbrella indeed, but who has left no address behind him, and
      no name.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI
    </h2>
    <p>
      WE are not concerned with the very poor. They are unthinkable and only to
      be approached by the statistician or the poet. This story deals with
      gentlefolk, or with those who are obliged to pretend that they are
      gentlefolk.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy, Leonard Bast, stood at the extreme verge of gentility. He was not
      in the abyss, but he could see it, and at times people whom he knew had
      dropped in, and counted no more. He knew that he was poor, and would admit
      it; he would have died sooner than confess any inferiority to the rich.
      This may be splendid of him. But he was inferior to most rich people,
      there is not the least doubt of it. He was not as courteous as the average
      rich man, nor as intelligent, nor as healthy, nor as lovable. His mind and
      his body had been alike underfed, because he was poor, and because he was
      modern they were always craving better food. Had he lived some centuries
      ago, in the brightly coloured civilisations of the past, he would have had
      a definite status, his rank and his income would have corresponded. But in
      his day the angel of Democracy had arisen, enshadowing the classes with
      leathern wings, and proclaiming, &ldquo;All men are equal&mdash;all men, that is
      to say, who possess umbrellas,&rdquo; and so he was obliged to assert gentility,
      lest he slip into the abyss where nothing counts, and the statements of
      Democracy are inaudible.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he walked away from Wickham Place, his first care was to prove that he
      was as good as the Miss Schlegels. Obscurely wounded in his pride, he
      tried to wound them in return. They were probably not ladies. Would real
      ladies have asked him to tea? They were certainly ill-natured and cold. At
      each step his feeling of superiority increased. Would a real lady have
      talked about stealing an umbrella? Perhaps they were thieves after all,
      and if he had gone into the house they would have clapped a chloroformed
      handkerchief over his face. He walked on complacently as far as the Houses
      of Parliament. There an empty stomach asserted itself, and told him that
      he was a fool.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Evening, Mr. Bast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Evening, Mr. Dealtry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nice evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dealtry, a fellow clerk, passed on, and Leonard stood wondering
      whether he would take the tram as far as a penny would take him, or
      whether he would walk. He decided to walk&mdash;it is no good giving in,
      and he had spent money enough at Queen&rsquo;s Hall&mdash;and he walked over
      Westminster Bridge, in front of St. Thomas&rsquo;s Hospital, and through the
      immense tunnel that passes under the South-Western main line at Vauxhall.
      In the tunnel he paused and listened to the roar of the trains. A sharp
      pain darted through his head, and he was conscious of the exact form of
      his eye sockets. He pushed on for another mile, and did not slacken speed
      until he stood at the entrance of a road called Camelia Road which was at
      present his home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here he stopped again, and glanced suspiciously to right and left, like a
      rabbit that is going to bolt into its hole. A block of flats, constructed
      with extreme cheapness, towered on either hand. Farther down the road two
      more blocks were being built, and beyond these an old house was being
      demolished to accommodate another pair. It was the kind of scene that may
      be observed all over London, whatever the locality&mdash;bricks and mortar
      rising and falling with the restlessness of the water in a fountain as the
      city receives more and more men upon her soil. Camelia Road would soon
      stand out like a fortress, and command, for a little, an extensive view.
      Only for a little. Plans were out for the erection of flats in Magnolia
      Road also. And again a few years, and all the flats in either road might
      be pulled down, and new buildings, of a vastness at present unimaginable,
      might arise where they had fallen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Evening, Mr. Bast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Evening, Mr. Cunningham.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very serious thing this decline of the birth-rate in Manchester.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very serious thing this decline of the birth-rate in Manchester,&rdquo;
       repeated Mr. Cunningham, tapping the Sunday paper, in which the calamity
      in question had just been announced to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes,&rdquo; said Leonard, who was not going to let on that he had not
      bought a Sunday paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If this kind of thing goes on the population of England will be
      stationary in 1960.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I call it a very serious thing, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-evening, Mr. Cunningham.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-evening, Mr. Bast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Leonard entered Block B of the flats, and turned, not upstairs, but
      down, into what is known to house agents as a semi-basement, and to other
      men as a cellar. He opened the door, and cried, &ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo; with the pseudo
      geniality of the Cockney. There was no reply. &ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo; he repeated. The
      sitting-room was empty, though the electric light had been left burning. A
      look of relief came over his face, and he flung himself into the armchair.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sitting-room contained, besides the armchair, two other chairs, a
      piano, a three-legged table, and a cosy corner. Of the walls, one was
      occupied by the window, the other by a draped mantelshelf bristling with
      Cupids. Opposite the window was the door, and beside the door a bookcase,
      while over the piano there extended one of the masterpieces of Maud
      Goodman. It was an amorous and not unpleasant little hole when the
      curtains were drawn, and the lights turned on, and the gas-stove unlit.
      But it struck that shallow makeshift note that is so often heard in the
      dwelling-place. It had been too easily gained, and could be relinquished
      too easily.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Leonard was kicking off his boots he jarred the three-legged table, and
      a photograph frame, honourably poised upon it, slid sideways, fell off
      into the fireplace, and smashed. He swore in a colourless sort of way, and
      picked the photograph up. It represented a young lady called Jacky, and
      had been taken at the time when young ladies called Jacky were often
      photographed with their mouths open. Teeth of dazzling whiteness extended
      along either of Jacky&rsquo;s jaws, and positively weighed her head sideways,
      so large were they and so numerous. Take my word for it, that smile was
      simply stunning, and it is only you and I who will be fastidious, and
      complain that true joy begins in the eyes, and that the eyes of Jacky did
      not accord with her smile, but were anxious and hungry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard tried to pull out the fragments of glass, and cut his fingers and
      swore again. A drop of blood fell on the frame, another followed, spilling
      over on to the exposed photograph. He swore more vigorously, and dashed
      into the kitchen, where he bathed his hands. The kitchen was the same size
      as the sitting-room; beyond it was a bedroom. This completed his home. He
      was renting the flat furnished; of all the objects that encumbered it none
      were his own except the photograph frame, the Cupids, and the books.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damn, damn, damnation!&rdquo; he murmured, together with such other words as he
      had learnt from older men. Then he raised his hand to his forehead and
      said, &ldquo;Oh, damn it all&mdash;&rdquo; which meant something different. He pulled
      himself together. He drank a little tea, black and silent, that still
      survived upon an upper shelf. He swallowed some dusty crumbs of a cake.
      Then he went back to the sitting-room, settled himself anew, and began to
      read a volume of Ruskin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seven miles to the north of Venice&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      How perfectly the famous chapter opens! How supreme its command of
      admonition and of poetry! The rich man is speaking to us from his gondola.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seven miles to the north of Venice the banks of sand which nearer the
      city rise little above low-water mark attain by degrees a higher level,
      and knit themselves at last into fields of salt morass, raised here and
      there into shapeless mounds, and intercepted by narrow creeks of sea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Leonard was trying to form his style on Ruskin; he understood him to be
      the greatest master of English Prose. He read forward steadily,
      occasionally making a few notes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us consider a little each of these characters in succession, and
      first (for of the shafts enough has been said already), what is very
      peculiar to this church&mdash;its luminousness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Was there anything to be learnt from this fine sentence? Could he adapt it
      to the needs of daily life? Could he introduce it, with modifications,
      when he next wrote a letter to his brother, the lay-reader? For example:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us consider a little each of these characters in succession, and
      first (for of the absence of ventilation enough has been said already),
      what is very peculiar to this flat&mdash;its obscurity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Something told him that the modifications would not do; and that
      something, had he known it, was the spirit of English Prose. &ldquo;My flat is
      dark as well as stuffy.&rdquo; Those were the words for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the voice in the gondola rolled on, piping melodiously of Effort and
      Self-Sacrifice, full of high purpose, full of beauty, full even of
      sympathy and the love of men, yet somehow eluding all that was actual and
      insistent in Leonard&rsquo;s life. For it was the voice of one who had never
      been dirty or hungry, and had not guessed successfully what dirt and
      hunger are.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard listened to it with reverence. He felt that he was being done good
      to, and that if he kept on with Ruskin, and the Queen&rsquo;s Hall Concerts, and
      some pictures by Watts, he would one day push his head out of the grey
      waters and see the universe. He believed in sudden conversion, a belief
      which may be right, but which is peculiarly attractive to a half-baked
      mind. It is the basis of much popular religion; in the domain of business
      it dominates the Stock Exchange, and becomes that &ldquo;bit of luck&rdquo; by which
      all successes and failures are explained. &ldquo;If only I had a bit of luck,
      the whole thing would come straight... He&rsquo;s got a most magnificent place
      down at Streatham and a 20 h.p. Fiat, but then, mind you, he&rsquo;s had luck...
      I&rsquo;m sorry the wife&rsquo;s so late, but she never has any luck over catching
      trains.&rdquo; Leonard was superior to these people; he did believe in effort
      and in a steady preparation for the change that he desired. But of a
      heritage that may expand gradually, he had no conception; he hoped to come
      to Culture suddenly, much as the Revivalist hopes to come to Jesus. Those
      Miss Schlegels had come to it; they had done the trick; their hands were
      upon the ropes, once and for all. And meanwhile, his flat was dark, as
      well as stuffy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently there was a noise on the staircase. He shut up Margaret&rsquo;s card
      in the pages of Ruskin, and opened the door. A woman entered, of whom it
      is simplest to say that she was not respectable. Her appearance was
      awesome. She seemed all strings and bell-pulls&mdash;ribbons, chains, bead
      necklaces that clinked and caught and a boa of azure feathers hung round
      her neck, with the ends uneven. Her throat was bare, wound with a double
      row of pearls, her arms were bare to the elbows, and might again be
      detected at the shoulder, through cheap lace. Her hat, which was flowery,
      resembled those punnets, covered with flannel, which we sowed with mustard
      and cress in our childhood, and which germinated here yes, and there no.
      She wore it on the back of her head. As for her hair, or rather hairs,
      they are too complicated to describe, but one system went down her back,
      lying in a thick pad there, while another, created for a lighter destiny,
      rippled around her forehead. The face&mdash;the face does not signify. It
      was the face of the photograph, but older, and the teeth were not so
      numerous as the photographer had suggested, and certainly not so white.
      Yes, Jacky was past her prime, whatever that prime may have been. She was
      descending quicker than most women into the colourless years, and the look
      in her eyes confessed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What ho!&rdquo; said Leonard, greeting the apparition with much spirit, and
      helping it off with its boa.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jacky, in husky tones, replied, &ldquo;What ho!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Been out?&rdquo; he asked. The question sounds superfluous, but it cannot have
      been really, for the lady answered, &ldquo;No,&rdquo; adding, &ldquo;Oh, I am so tired.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You tired?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired,&rdquo; said he, hanging the boa up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Len, I am so tired.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been to that classical concert I told you about,&rdquo; said Leonard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came back as soon as it was over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any one been round to our place?&rdquo; asked Jacky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not that I&rsquo;ve seen. I met Mr. Cunningham outside, and we passed a few
      remarks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, not Mr. Cunningham?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you mean Mr. Cunningham.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Mr. Cunningham.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been out to tea at a lady friend&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her secret being at last given&mdash;to the world, and the name of the
      lady friend being even adumbrated, Jacky made no further experiments in
      the difficult and tiring art of conversation. She never had been a great
      talker. Even in her photographic days she had relied upon her smile and
      her figure to attract, and now that she was
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
      &ldquo;On the shelf,
       On the shelf,
       Boys, boys, I&rsquo;m on the shelf,&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      she was not likely to find her tongue. Occasional bursts of song (of which
      the above is an example) still issued from her lips, but the spoken word
      was rare.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat down on Leonard&rsquo;s knee, and began to fondle him. She was now a
      massive woman of thirty-three, and her weight hurt him, but he could not
      very well say anything. Then she said, &ldquo;Is that a book you&rsquo;re reading?&rdquo;
       and he said, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a book,&rdquo; and drew it from her unreluctant grasp.
      Margaret&rsquo;s card fell out of it. It fell face downwards, and he murmured,
      &ldquo;Bookmarker.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Len&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he asked, a little wearily, for she only had one topic of
      conversation when she sat upon his knee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do love me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jacky, you know that I do. How can you ask such questions!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you do love me, Len, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A pause. The other remark was still due.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Len&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well? What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Len, you will make it all right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t have you ask me that again,&rdquo; said the boy, flaring up into a
      sudden passion. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve promised to marry you when I&rsquo;m of age, and that&rsquo;s
      enough. My word&rsquo;s my word. I&rsquo;ve promised to marry you as soon as ever I&rsquo;m
      twenty-one, and I can&rsquo;t keep on being worried. I&rsquo;ve worries enough. It
      isn&rsquo;t likely I&rsquo;d throw you over, let alone my word, when I&rsquo;ve spent all
      this money. Besides, I&rsquo;m an Englishman, and I never go back on my word.
      Jacky, do be reasonable. Of course I&rsquo;ll marry you. Only do stop badgering
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When&rsquo;s your birthday, Len?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told you again and again, the eleventh of November next. Now get off
      my knee a bit; some one must get supper, I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jacky went through to the bedroom, and began to see to her hat. This meant
      blowing at it with short sharp puffs. Leonard tidied up the sitting-room,
      and began to prepare their evening meal. He put a penny into the slot of
      the gas-meter, and soon the flat was reeking with metallic fumes. Somehow
      he could not recover his temper, and all the time he was cooking he
      continued to complain bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It really is too bad when a fellow isn&rsquo;t trusted. It makes one feel so
      wild, when I&rsquo;ve pretended to the people here that you&rsquo;re my wife&mdash;all
      right, all right, you SHALL be my wife&mdash;and I&rsquo;ve bought you the ring
      to wear, and I&rsquo;ve taken this flat furnished, and it&rsquo;s far more than I can
      afford, and yet you aren&rsquo;t content, and I&rsquo;ve also not told the truth when
      I&rsquo;ve written home.&rdquo; He lowered his voice. &ldquo;He&rsquo;d stop it.&rdquo; In a tone of
      horror, that was a little luxurious, he repeated: &ldquo;My brother&rsquo;d stop it.
      I&rsquo;m going against the whole world, Jacky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I am, Jacky. I don&rsquo;t take any heed of what any one says. I
      just go straight forward, I do. That&rsquo;s always been my way. I&rsquo;m not one of
      your weak knock-kneed chaps. If a woman&rsquo;s in trouble, I don&rsquo;t leave her in
      the lurch. That&rsquo;s not my street. No, thank you.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you another thing too. I care a good deal about improving
      myself by means of Literature and Art, and so getting a wider outlook. For
      instance, when you came in I was reading Ruskin&rsquo;s Stones of Venice. I
      don&rsquo;t say this to boast, but just to show you the kind of man I am. I can
      tell you, I enjoyed that classical concert this afternoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To all his moods Jacky remained equally indifferent. When supper was ready&mdash;and
      not before&mdash;she emerged from the bedroom, saying: &ldquo;But you do love
      me, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They began with a soup square, which Leonard had just dissolved in some
      hot water. It was followed by the tongue&mdash;a freckled cylinder of
      meat, with a little jelly at the top, and a great deal of yellow fat at
      the bottom&mdash;ending with another square dissolved in water (jelly:
      pineapple), which Leonard had prepared earlier in the day. Jacky ate
      contentedly enough, occasionally looking at her man with those anxious
      eyes, to which nothing else in her appearance corresponded, and which yet
      seemed to mirror her soul. And Leonard managed to convince his stomach
      that it was having a nourishing meal.
    </p>
    <p>
      After supper they smoked cigarettes and exchanged a few statements. She
      observed that her &ldquo;likeness&rdquo; had been broken. He found occasion to remark,
      for the second time, that he had come straight back home after the concert
      at Queen&rsquo;s Hall. Presently she sat upon his knee. The inhabitants of
      Camelia Road tramped to and fro outside the window, just on a level with
      their heads, and the family in the flat on the ground-floor began to sing,
      &ldquo;Hark, my soul, it is the Lord.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That tune fairly gives me the hump,&rdquo; said Leonard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jacky followed this, and said that, for her part, she thought it a lovely
      tune.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I&rsquo;ll play you something lovely. Get up, dear, for a minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went to the piano and jingled out a little Grieg. He played badly and
      vulgarly, but the performance was not without its effect, for Jacky said
      she thought she&rsquo;d be going to bed. As she receded, a new set of interests
      possessed the boy, and he began to think of what had been said about music
      by that odd Miss Schlegel&mdash;the one that twisted her face about so
      when she spoke. Then the thoughts grew sad and envious. There was the girl
      named Helen, who had pinched his umbrella, and the German girl who had
      smiled at him pleasantly, and Herr some one, and Aunt some one, and the
      brother&mdash;all, all with their hands on the ropes. They had all passed
      up that narrow, rich staircase at Wickham Place to some ample room,
      whither he could never follow them, not if he read for ten hours a day.
      Oh, it was no good, this continual aspiration. Some are born cultured; the
      rest had better go in for whatever comes easy. To see life steadily and to
      see it whole was not for the likes of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the darkness beyond the kitchen a voice called, &ldquo;Len?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You in bed?&rdquo; he asked, his forehead twitching.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Presently she called him again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must clean my boots ready for the morning,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently she called him again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I rather want to get this chapter done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He closed his ears against her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Jacky, nothing; I&rsquo;m reading a book.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; he answered, catching her degraded deafness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently she called him again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ruskin had visited Torcello by this time, and was ordering his gondoliers
      to take him to Murano. It occurred to him, as he glided over the
      whispering lagoons, that the power of Nature could not be shortened by the
      folly, nor her beauty altogether saddened by the misery of such as
      Leonard.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Margaret,&rdquo; cried her aunt next morning, &ldquo;such a most unfortunate
      thing has happened. I could not get you alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The most unfortunate thing was not very serious. One of the flats in the
      ornate block opposite had been taken furnished by the Wilcox family,
      &ldquo;coming up, no doubt, in the hope of getting into London society.&rdquo; That
      Mrs. Munt should be the first to discover the misfortune was not
      remarkable, for she was so interested in the flats, that she watched their
      every mutation with unwearying care. In theory she despised them&mdash;they
      took away that old-world look&mdash;they cut off the sun&mdash;flats house
      a flashy type of person. But if the truth had been known, she found her
      visits to Wickham Place twice as amusing since Wickham Mansions had
      arisen, and would in a couple of days learn more about them than her
      nieces in a couple of months, or her nephew in a couple of years. She
      would stroll across and make friends with the porters, and inquire what
      the rents were, exclaiming for example: &ldquo;What! a hundred and twenty for a
      basement? You&rsquo;ll never get it!&rdquo; And they would answer: &ldquo;One can but try,
      madam.&rdquo; The passenger lifts, the arrangement for coals (a great temptation
      for a dishonest porter), were all familiar matters to her, and perhaps a
      relief from the politico-economical-esthetic atmosphere that reigned at
      the Schlegels.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret received the information calmly, and did not agree that it would
      throw a cloud over poor Helen&rsquo;s life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but Helen isn&rsquo;t a girl with no interests,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;She has
      plenty of other things and other people to think about. She made a false
      start with the Wilcoxes, and she&rsquo;ll be as willing as we are to have
      nothing more to do with them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For a clever girl, dear, how very oddly you do talk. Helen&rsquo;ll HAVE to
      have something more to do with them, now that they&rsquo;re all opposite. She
      may meet that Paul in the street. She cannot very well not bow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course she must bow. But look here; let&rsquo;s do the flowers. I was going
      to say, the will to be interested in him has died, and what else matters?
      I look on that disastrous episode (over which you were so kind) as the
      killing of a nerve in Helen. It&rsquo;s dead, and she&rsquo;ll never be troubled with
      it again. The only things that matter are the things that interest one.
      Bowing, even calling and leaving cards, even a dinner-party&mdash;we can
      do all those things to the Wilcoxes, if they find it agreeable; but the
      other thing, the one important thing&mdash;never again. Don&rsquo;t you see?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Munt did not see, and indeed Margaret was making a most questionable
      statement&mdash;that any emotion, any interest once vividly aroused, can
      wholly die.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I also have the honour to inform you that the Wilcoxes are bored with us.
      I didn&rsquo;t tell you at the time&mdash;it might have made you angry, and you
      had enough to worry you&mdash;but I wrote a letter to Mrs. W, and
      apologised for the trouble that Helen had given them. She didn&rsquo;t answer
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How very rude!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder. Or was it sensible?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Margaret, most rude.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In either case one can class it as reassuring.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Munt sighed. She was going back to Swanage on the morrow, just as her
      nieces were wanting her most. Other regrets crowded upon her: for
      instance, how magnificently she would have cut Charles if she had met him
      face to face. She had already seen him, giving an order to the porter&mdash;and
      very common he looked in a tall hat. But unfortunately his back was turned
      to her, and though she had cut his back, she could not regard this as a
      telling snub.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you will be careful, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; she exhorted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, certainly. Fiendishly careful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Helen must be careful, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Careful over what?&rdquo; cried Helen, at that moment coming into the room with
      her cousin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing&rdquo; said Margaret, seized with a momentary awkwardness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Careful over what, Aunt Juley?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Munt assumed a cryptic air. &ldquo;It is only that a certain family, whom
      we know by name but do not mention, as you said yourself last night after
      the concert, have taken the flat opposite from the Mathesons&mdash;where
      the plants are in the balcony.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen began some laughing reply, and then disconcerted them all by
      blushing. Mrs. Munt was so disconcerted that she exclaimed, &ldquo;What, Helen,
      you don&rsquo;t mind them coming, do you?&rdquo; and deepened the blush to crimson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I don&rsquo;t mind,&rdquo; said Helen a little crossly. &ldquo;It is that you and
      Meg are both so absurdly grave about it, when there&rsquo;s nothing to be grave
      about at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not grave,&rdquo; protested Margaret, a little cross in her turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you look grave; doesn&rsquo;t she, Frieda?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel grave, that&rsquo;s all I can say; you&rsquo;re going quite on the wrong
      tack.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, she does not feel grave,&rdquo; echoed Mrs. Munt. &ldquo;I can bear witness to
      that. She disagrees&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hark!&rdquo; interrupted Fraulein Mosebach. &ldquo;I hear Bruno entering the hall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For Herr Liesecke was due at Wickham Place to call for the two younger
      girls. He was not entering the hall&mdash;in fact, he did not enter it for
      quite five minutes. But Frieda detected a delicate situation, and said
      that she and Helen had much better wait for Bruno down below, and leave
      Margaret and Mrs. Munt to finish arranging the flowers. Helen acquiesced.
      But, as if to prove that the situation was not delicate really, she
      stopped in the doorway and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you say the Mathesons&rsquo; flat, Aunt Juley? How wonderful you are! I
      never knew that the name of the woman who laced too tightly was Matheson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Helen,&rdquo; said her cousin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go, Helen,&rdquo; said her aunt; and continued to Margaret almost in the same
      breath: &ldquo;Helen cannot deceive me. She does mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, hush!&rdquo; breathed Margaret. &ldquo;Frieda&rsquo;ll hear you, and she can be so
      tiresome.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She minds,&rdquo; persisted Mrs. Munt, moving thoughtfully about the room, and
      pulling the dead chrysanthemums out of the vases. &ldquo;I knew she&rsquo;d mind&mdash;and
      I&rsquo;m sure a girl ought to! Such an experience! Such awful coarse-grained
      people! I know more about them than you do, which you forget, and if
      Charles had taken you that motor drive&mdash;well, you&rsquo;d have reached the
      house a perfect wreck. Oh, Margaret, you don&rsquo;t know what you are in for!
      They&rsquo;re all bottled up against the drawing-room window. There&rsquo;s Mrs.
      Wilcox&mdash;I&rsquo;ve seen her. There&rsquo;s Paul. There&rsquo;s Evie, who is a minx.
      There&rsquo;s Charles&mdash;I saw him to start with. And who would an elderly
      man with a moustache and a copper-coloured face be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Wilcox, possibly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew it. And there&rsquo;s Mr. Wilcox.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a shame to call his face copper colour,&rdquo; complained Margaret. &ldquo;He
      has a remarkably good complexion for a man of his age.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Munt, triumphant elsewhere, could afford to concede Mr. Wilcox his
      complexion. She passed on from it to the plan of campaign that her nieces
      should pursue in the future. Margaret tried to stop her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Helen did not take the news quite as I expected, but the Wilcox nerve is
      dead in her really, so there&rsquo;s no need for plans.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s as well to be prepared.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;it&rsquo;s as well not to be prepared.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her thought drew being from the obscure borderland. She could not explain
      in so many words, but she felt that those who prepare for all the
      emergencies of life beforehand may equip themselves at the expense of joy.
      It is necessary to prepare for an examination, or a dinner-party, or a
      possible fall in the price of stock: those who attempt human relations
      must adopt another method, or fail. &ldquo;Because I&rsquo;d sooner risk it,&rdquo; was her
      lame conclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But imagine the evenings,&rdquo; exclaimed her aunt, pointing to the Mansions
      with the spout of the watering can. &ldquo;Turn the electric light on here or
      there, and it&rsquo;s almost the same room. One evening they may forget to draw
      their blinds down, and you&rsquo;ll see them; and the next, you yours, and
      they&rsquo;ll see you. Impossible to sit out on the balconies. Impossible to
      water the plants, or even speak. Imagine going out of the front-door, and
      they come out opposite at the same moment. And yet you tell me that plans
      are unnecessary, and you&rsquo;d rather risk it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope to risk things all my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Margaret, most dangerous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But after all,&rdquo; she continued with a smile, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s never any great risk
      as long as you have money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, shame! What a shocking speech!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Money pads the edges of things,&rdquo; said Miss Schlegel. &ldquo;God help those who
      have none.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this is something quite new!&rdquo; said Mrs. Munt, who collected new ideas
      as a squirrel collects nuts, and was especially attracted by those that
      are portable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;New for me; sensible people have acknowledged it for years. You and I and
      the Wilcoxes stand upon money as upon islands. It is so firm beneath our
      feet that we forget its very existence. It&rsquo;s only when we see some one
      near us tottering that we realise all that an independent income means.
      Last night, when we were talking up here round the fire, I began to think
      that the very soul of the world is economic, and that the lowest abyss is
      not the absence of love, but the absence of coin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I call that rather cynical.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So do I. But Helen and I, we ought to remember, when we are tempted to
      criticise others, that we are standing on these islands, and that most of
      the others are down below the surface of the sea. The poor cannot always
      reach those whom they want to love, and they can hardly ever escape from
      those whom they love no longer. We rich can. Imagine the tragedy last
      June, if Helen and Paul Wilcox had been poor people, and couldn&rsquo;t invoke
      railways and motor-cars to part them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s more like Socialism,&rdquo; said Mrs. Munt suspiciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call it what you like. I call it going through life with one&rsquo;s hand
      spread open on the table. I&rsquo;m tired of these rich people who pretend to be
      poor, and think it shows a nice mind to ignore the piles of money that
      keep their feet above the waves. I stand each year upon six hundred
      pounds, and Helen upon the same, and Tibby will stand upon eight, and as
      fast as our pounds crumble away into the sea they are renewed&mdash;from
      the sea, yes, from the sea. And all our thoughts are the thoughts of
      six-hundred-pounders, and all our speeches; and because we don&rsquo;t want to
      steal umbrellas ourselves, we forget that below the sea people do want to
      steal them and do steal them sometimes, and that what&rsquo;s a joke up here is
      down there reality.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There they go&mdash;there goes Fraulein Mosebach. Really, for a German
      she does dress charmingly. Oh!&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Helen was looking up at the Wilcoxes&rsquo; flat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon, I interrupted you. What was it you were saying about
      reality?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had worked round to myself, as usual,&rdquo; answered Margaret in tones that
      were suddenly preoccupied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do tell me this, at all events. Are you for the rich or for the poor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too difficult. Ask me another. Am I for poverty or for riches? For
      riches. Hurrah for riches!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For riches!&rdquo; echoed Mrs. Munt, having, as it were, at last secured her
      nut.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. For riches. Money for ever!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So am I, and so, I am afraid, are most of my acquaintances at Swanage,
      but I am surprised that you agree with us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you so much, Aunt Juley. While I have talked theories, you have
      done the flowers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all, dear. I wish you would let me help you in more important
      things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, would you be very kind? Would you come round with me to the
      registry office? There&rsquo;s a housemaid who won&rsquo;t say yes but doesn&rsquo;t say
      no.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On their way thither they too looked up at the Wilcoxes&rsquo; flat. Evie was in
      the balcony, &ldquo;staring most rudely,&rdquo; according to Mrs. Munt. Oh yes, it was
      a nuisance, there was no doubt of it. Helen was proof against a passing
      encounter, but&mdash;Margaret began to lose confidence. Might it reawake
      the dying nerve if the family were living close against her eyes? And
      Frieda Mosebach was stopping with them for another fortnight, and Frieda
      was sharp, abominably sharp, and quite capable of remarking, &ldquo;You love one
      of the young gentlemen opposite, yes?&rdquo; The remark would be untrue, but of
      the kind which, if stated often enough, may become true; just as the
      remark, &ldquo;England and Germany are bound to fight,&rdquo; renders war a little
      more likely each time that it is made, and is therefore made the more
      readily by the gutter press of either nation. Have the private emotions
      also their gutter press? Margaret thought so, and feared that good Aunt
      Juley and Frieda were typical specimens of it. They might, by continual
      chatter, lead Helen into a repetition of the desires of June. Into a
      repetition&mdash;they could not do more; they could not lead her into
      lasting love. They were&mdash;she saw it clearly&mdash;Journalism; her
      father, with all his defects and wrong-headedness, had been Literature,
      and had he lived, he would have persuaded his daughter rightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The registry office was holding its morning reception. A string of
      carriages filled the street. Miss Schlegel waited her turn, and finally
      had to be content with an insidious &ldquo;temporary,&rdquo; being rejected by genuine
      housemaids on the ground of her numerous stairs. Her failure depressed
      her, and though she forgot the failure, the depression remained. On her
      way home she again glanced up at the Wilcoxes&rsquo; flat, and took the rather
      matronly step of speaking about the matter to Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Helen, you must tell me whether this thing worries you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If what?&rdquo; said Helen, who was washing her hands for lunch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Ws&rsquo; coming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, of course not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really.&rdquo; Then she admitted that she was a little worried on Mrs. Wilcox&rsquo;s
      account; she implied that Mrs. Wilcox might reach backward into deep
      feelings, and be pained by things that never touched the other members of
      that clan. &ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t mind if Paul points at our house and says, &lsquo;There
      lives the girl who tried to catch me.&rsquo; But she might.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If even that worries you, we could arrange something. There&rsquo;s no reason
      we should be near people who displease us or whom we displease, thanks to
      our money. We might even go away for a little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I am going away. Frieda&rsquo;s just asked me to Stettin, and I shan&rsquo;t be
      back till after the New Year. Will that do? Or must I fly the country
      altogether? Really, Meg, what has come over you to make such a fuss?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m getting an old maid, I suppose. I thought I minded nothing, but
      really I&mdash;I should be bored if you fell in love with the same man
      twice and&rdquo;&mdash;she cleared her throat&mdash;&ldquo;you did go red, you know,
      when Aunt Juley attacked you this morning. I shouldn&rsquo;t have referred to it
      otherwise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Helen&rsquo;s laugh rang true, as she raised a soapy hand to heaven and
      swore that never, nowhere and nohow, would she again fall in love with any
      of the Wilcox family, down to its remotest collaterals.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      The friendship between Margaret and Mrs. Wilcox, which was to develop so
      quickly and with such strange results, may perhaps have had its beginnings
      at Speyer, in the spring. Perhaps the elder lady, as she gazed at the
      vulgar, ruddy cathedral, and listened to the talk of her husband and
      Helen, may have detected in the other and less charming of the sisters a
      deeper sympathy, a sounder judgment. She was capable of detecting such
      things. Perhaps it was she who had desired the Miss Schlegels to be
      invited to Howards End, and Margaret whose presence she had particularly
      desired. All this is speculation; Mrs. Wilcox has left few clear
      indications behind her. It is certain that she came to call at Wickham
      Place a fortnight later, the very day that Helen was going with her cousin
      to Stettin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Helen!&rdquo; cried Fraulein Mosebach in awestruck tones (she was now in her
      cousin&rsquo;s confidence)&mdash;&ldquo;his mother has forgiven you!&rdquo; And then,
      remembering that in England the new-comer ought not to call before she is
      called upon, she changed her tone from awe to disapproval, and opined that
      Mrs. Wilcox was keine Dame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bother the whole family!&rdquo; snapped Margaret. &ldquo;Helen, stop giggling and
      pirouetting, and go and finish your packing. Why can&rsquo;t the woman leave us
      alone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I shall do with Meg,&rdquo; Helen retorted, collapsing upon
      the stairs. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s got Wilcox and Box upon the brain. Meg, Meg, I don&rsquo;t
      love the young gentleman; I don&rsquo;t love the young gentleman, Meg, Meg. Can
      a body speak plainer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most certainly her love has died,&rdquo; asserted Fraulein Mosebach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most certainly it has, Frieda, but that will not prevent me from being
      bored with the Wilcoxes if I return the call.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Helen simulated tears, and Fraulein Mosebach, who thought her
      extremely amusing, did the same. &ldquo;Oh, boo hoo! boo hoo hoo! Meg&rsquo;s going to
      return the call, and I can&rsquo;t. &lsquo;Cos why? &lsquo;Cos I&rsquo;m going to German-eye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you are going to Germany, go and pack; if you aren&rsquo;t, go and call on
      the Wilcoxes instead of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Meg, Meg, I don&rsquo;t love the young gentleman; I don&rsquo;t love the young&mdash;O
      lud, who&rsquo;s that coming down the stairs? I vow &lsquo;tis my brother. O crimini!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A male&mdash;even such a male as Tibby&mdash;was enough to stop the
      foolery. The barrier of sex, though decreasing among the civilised, is
      still high, and higher on the side of women. Helen could tell her sister
      all, and her cousin much about Paul; she told her brother nothing. It was
      not prudishness, for she now spoke of &ldquo;the Wilcox ideal&rdquo; with laughter,
      and even with a growing brutality. Nor was it precaution, for Tibby seldom
      repeated any news that did not concern himself. It was rather the feeling
      that she betrayed a secret into the camp of men, and that, however trivial
      it was on this side of the barrier, it would become important on that. So
      she stopped, or rather began to fool on other subjects, until her
      long-suffering relatives drove her upstairs. Fraulein Mosebach followed
      her, but lingered to say heavily over the banisters to Margaret, &ldquo;It is
      all right&mdash;she does not love the young man&mdash;he has not been
      worthy of her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know; thanks very much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought I did right to tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ever so many thanks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; asked Tibby. No one told him, and he proceeded into the
      dining-room, to eat plums.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening Margaret took decisive action. The house was very quiet, and
      the fog&mdash;we are in November now&mdash;pressed against the windows
      like an excluded ghost. Frieda and Helen and all their luggages had gone.
      Tibby, who was not feeling well, lay stretched on a sofa by the fire.
      Margaret sat by him, thinking. Her mind darted from impulse to impulse,
      and finally marshalled them all in review. The practical person, who knows
      what he wants at once, and generally knows nothing else, will accuse her
      of indecision. But this was the way her mind worked. And when she did act,
      no one could accuse her of indecision then. She hit out as lustily as if
      she had not considered the matter at all. The letter that she wrote Mrs.
      Wilcox glowed with the native hue of resolution. The pale cast of thought
      was with her a breath rather than a tarnish, a breath that leaves the
      colours all the more vivid when it has been wiped away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;DEAR MRS. WILCOX,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have to write something discourteous. It would be better if we did not
      meet. Both my sister and my aunt have given displeasure to your family,
      and, in my sister&rsquo;s case, the grounds for displeasure might recur. So far
      as I know she no longer occupies her thoughts with your son. But it would
      not be fair, either to her or to you, if they met, and it is therefore
      right that our acquaintance, which began so pleasantly, should end.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear that you will not agree with this; indeed, I know that you will
      not, since you have been good enough to call on us. It is only an instinct
      on my part, and no doubt the instinct is wrong. My sister would,
      undoubtedly, say that it is wrong. I write without her knowledge, and I
      hope that you will not associate her with my discourtesy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Believe me,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yours truly,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. J. SCHLEGEL.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret sent this letter round by the post. Next morning she received the
      following reply by hand:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;DEAR MISS SCHLEGEL,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should not have written me such a letter. I called to tell you that
      Paul has gone abroad.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;RUTH WILCOX.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret&rsquo;s cheeks burnt. She could not finish her breakfast. She was on
      fire with shame. Helen had told her that the youth was leaving England,
      but other things had seemed more important, and she had forgotten. All her
      absurd anxieties fell to the ground, and in their place arose the
      certainty that she had been rude to Mrs. Wilcox. Rudeness affected
      Margaret like a bitter taste in the mouth. It poisoned life. At times it
      is necessary, but woe to those who employ it without due need. She flung
      on a hat and shawl, just like a poor woman, and plunged into the fog,
      which still continued. Her lips were compressed, the letter remained in
      her hand, and in this state she crossed the street, entered the marble
      vestibule of the flats, eluded the concierges, and ran up the stairs till
      she reached the second floor. She sent in her name, and to her surprise
      was shown straight into Mrs. Wilcox&rsquo;s bedroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Mrs. Wilcox, I have made the baddest blunder. I am more, more ashamed
      and sorry than I can say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Wilcox bowed gravely. She was offended, and did not pretend to the
      contrary. She was sitting up in bed, writing letters on an invalid table
      that spanned her knees. A breakfast tray was on another table beside her.
      The light of the fire, the light from the window, and the light of a
      candle-lamp, which threw a quivering halo round her hands combined to
      create a strange atmosphere of dissolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew he was going to India in November, but I forgot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He sailed on the 17th for Nigeria, in Africa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew&mdash;I know. I have been too absurd all through. I am very much
      ashamed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Wilcox did not answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am more sorry than I can say, and I hope that you will forgive me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter, Miss Schlegel. It is good of you to have come round so
      promptly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It does matter,&rdquo; cried Margaret. &ldquo;I have been rude to you; and my sister
      is not even at home, so there was not even that excuse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has just gone to Germany.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She gone as well,&rdquo; murmured the other. &ldquo;Yes, certainly, it is quite safe&mdash;safe,
      absolutely, now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been worrying too!&rdquo; exclaimed Margaret, getting more and more
      excited, and taking a chair without invitation. &ldquo;How perfectly
      extraordinary! I can see that you have. You felt as I do; Helen mustn&rsquo;t
      meet him again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did think it best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a most difficult question,&rdquo; said Mrs. Wilcox, smiling, and a
      little losing her expression of annoyance. &ldquo;I think you put it best in
      your letter&mdash;it was an instinct, which may be wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t that your son still&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no; he often&mdash;my Paul is very young, you see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what was it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She repeated: &ldquo;An instinct which may be wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In other words, they belong to types that can fall in love, but couldn&rsquo;t
      live together. That&rsquo;s dreadfully probable. I&rsquo;m afraid that in nine cases
      out of ten Nature pulls one way and human nature another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These are indeed &lsquo;other words,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Mrs. Wilcox. &ldquo;I had nothing so
      coherent in my head. I was merely alarmed when I knew that my boy cared
      for your sister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, I have always been wanting to ask you. How DID you know? Helen was so
      surprised when our aunt drove up, and you stepped forward and arranged
      things. Did Paul tell you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is nothing to be gained by discussing that,&rdquo; said Mrs. Wilcox after
      a moment&rsquo;s pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Wilcox, were you very angry with us last June? I wrote you a letter
      and you didn&rsquo;t answer it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was certainly against taking Mrs. Matheson&rsquo;s flat. I knew it was
      opposite your house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s all right now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You only think? You aren&rsquo;t sure? I do love these little muddles tidied
      up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; said Mrs. Wilcox, moving with uneasiness beneath the
      clothes. &ldquo;I always sound uncertain over things. It is my way of speaking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, and I&rsquo;m sure, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here the maid came in to remove the breakfast-tray. They were interrupted,
      and when they resumed conversation it was on more normal lines.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must say good-bye now&mdash;you will be getting up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;please stop a little longer&mdash;I am taking a day in bed. Now
      and then I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought of you as one of the early risers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At Howards End&mdash;yes; there is nothing to get up for in London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing to get up for?&rdquo; cried the scandalised Margaret. &ldquo;When there are
      all the autumn exhibitions, and Ysaye playing in the afternoon! Not to
      mention people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The truth is, I am a little tired. First came the wedding, and then Paul
      went off, and, instead of resting yesterday, I paid a round of calls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A wedding?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; Charles, my elder son, is married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We took the flat chiefly on that account, and also that Paul could get
      his African outfit. The flat belongs to a cousin of my husband&rsquo;s, and she
      most kindly offered it to us. So before the day came we were able to make
      the acquaintance of Dolly&rsquo;s people, which we had not yet done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret asked who Dolly&rsquo;s people were.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fussell. The father is in the Indian army&mdash;retired; the brother is
      in the army. The mother is dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So perhaps these were the &ldquo;chinless sunburnt men&rdquo; whom Helen had espied
      one afternoon through the window. Margaret felt mildly interested in the
      fortunes of the Wilcox family. She had acquired the habit on Helen&rsquo;s
      account, and it still clung to her. She asked for more information about
      Miss Dolly Fussell that was, and was given it in even, unemotional tones.
      Mrs. Wilcox&rsquo;s voice, though sweet and compelling, had little range of
      expression. It suggested that pictures, concerts, and people are all of
      small and equal value. Only once had it quickened&mdash;when speaking of
      Howards End.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Charles and Albert Fussell have known one another some time. They belong
      to the same club, and are both devoted to golf. Dolly plays golf too,
      though I believe not so well; and they first met in a mixed foursome. We
      all like her, and are very much pleased. They were married on the 11th, a
      few days before Paul sailed. Charles was very anxious to have his brother
      as best man, so he made a great point of having it on the 11th. The
      Fussells would have preferred it after Christmas, but they were very nice
      about it. There is Dolly&rsquo;s photograph&mdash;in that double frame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you quite certain that I&rsquo;m not interrupting, Mrs. Wilcox?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, quite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I will stay. I&rsquo;m enjoying this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dolly&rsquo;s photograph was now examined. It was signed &ldquo;For dear Mims,&rdquo; which
      Mrs. Wilcox interpreted as &ldquo;the name she and Charles had settled that she
      should call me.&rdquo; Dolly looked silly, and had one of those triangular faces
      that so often prove attractive to a robust man. She was very pretty. From
      her Margaret passed to Charles, whose features prevailed opposite. She
      speculated on the forces that had drawn the two together till God parted
      them. She found time to hope that they would be happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have gone to Naples for their honeymoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lucky people!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can hardly imagine Charles in Italy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t he care for travelling?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He likes travel, but he does see through foreigners so. What he enjoys
      most is a motor tour in England, and I think that would have carried the
      day if the weather had not been so abominable. His father gave him a car
      for a wedding present, which for the present is being stored at Howards
      End.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you have a garage there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. My husband built a little one only last month, to the west of the
      house, not far from the wych-elm, in what used to be the paddock for the
      pony.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The last words had an indescribable ring about them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the pony gone?&rdquo; asked Margaret after a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The pony? Oh, dead, ever so long ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The wych-elm I remember. Helen spoke of it as a very splendid tree.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the finest wych-elm in Hertfordshire. Did your sister tell you
      about the teeth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it might interest you. There are pigs&rsquo; teeth stuck into the trunk,
      about four feet from the ground. The country people put them in long ago,
      and they think that if they chew a piece of the bark, it will cure the
      toothache. The teeth are almost grown over now, and no one comes to the
      tree.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should. I love folklore and all festering superstitions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think that the tree really did cure toothache, if one believed in
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it did. It would cure anything&mdash;once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly I remember cases&mdash;you see I lived at Howards End long,
      long before Mr. Wilcox knew it. I was born there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The conversation again shifted. At the time it seemed little more than
      aimless chatter. She was interested when her hostess explained that
      Howards End was her own property. She was bored when too minute an account
      was given of the Fussell family, of the anxieties of Charles concerning
      Naples, of the movements of Mr. Wilcox and Evie, who were motoring in
      Yorkshire. Margaret could not bear being bored. She grew inattentive,
      played with the photograph frame, dropped it, smashed Dolly&rsquo;s glass,
      apologised, was pardoned, cut her finger thereon, was pitied, and finally
      said she must be going&mdash;there was all the housekeeping to do, and she
      had to interview Tibby&rsquo;s riding-master.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the curious note was struck again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, Miss Schlegel, good-bye. Thank you for coming. You have cheered
      me up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I wonder whether you ever think about yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think of nothing else,&rdquo; said Margaret, blushing, but letting her hand
      remain in that of the invalid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder. I wondered at Heidelberg.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;M sure!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I almost think&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; asked Margaret, for there was a long pause&mdash;a pause that was
      somehow akin to the flicker of the fire, the quiver of the reading-lamp
      upon their hands, the white blur from the window; a pause of shifting and
      eternal shadows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I almost think you forget you&rsquo;re a girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret was startled and a little annoyed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m twenty-nine,&rdquo; she
      remarked. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not so wildly girlish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Wilcox smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What makes you say that? Do you mean that I have been gauche and rude?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A shake of the head. &ldquo;I only meant that I am fifty-one, and that to me
      both of you&mdash;Read it all in some book or other; I cannot put things
      clearly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ve got it&mdash;inexperience. I&rsquo;m no better than Helen, you mean,
      and yet I presume to advise her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. You have got it. Inexperience is the word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Inexperience,&rdquo; repeated Margaret, in serious yet buoyant tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, I have everything to learn&mdash;absolutely everything&mdash;just
      as much as Helen. Life&rsquo;s very difficult and full of surprises. At all
      events, I&rsquo;ve got as far as that. To be humble and kind, to go straight
      ahead, to love people rather than pity them, to remember the submerged&mdash;well,
      one can&rsquo;t do all these things at once, worse luck, because they&rsquo;re so
      contradictory. It&rsquo;s then that proportion comes in&mdash;to live by
      proportion. Don&rsquo;t BEGIN with proportion. Only prigs do that. Let
      proportion come in as a last resource, when the better things have failed,
      and a deadlock&mdash;Gracious me, I&rsquo;ve started preaching!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, you put the difficulties of life splendidly,&rdquo; said Mrs. Wilcox,
      withdrawing her hand into the deeper shadows. &ldquo;It is just what I should
      have liked to say about them myself.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mrs. Wilcox cannot be accused of giving Margaret much information about
      life. And Margaret, on the other hand, has made a fair show of modesty,
      and has pretended to an inexperience that she certainly did not feel. She
      had kept house for over ten years; she had entertained, almost with
      distinction; she had brought up a charming sister, and was bringing up a
      brother. Surely, if experience is attainable, she had attained it. Yet the
      little luncheon-party that she gave in Mrs. Wilcox&rsquo;s honour was not a
      success. The new friend did not blend with the &ldquo;one or two delightful
      people&rdquo; who had been asked to meet her, and the atmosphere was one of
      polite bewilderment. Her tastes were simple, her knowledge of culture
      slight, and she was not interested in the New English Art Club, nor in the
      dividing-line between Journalism and Literature, which was started as a
      conversational hare. The delightful people darted after it with cries of
      joy, Margaret leading them, and not till the meal was half over did they
      realise that the principal guest had taken no part in the chase. There was
      no common topic. Mrs. Wilcox, whose life had been spent in the service of
      husband and sons, had little to say to strangers who had never shared it,
      and whose age was half her own. Clever talk alarmed her, and withered her
      delicate imaginings; it was the social counterpart of a motor-car, all
      jerks, and she was a wisp of hay, a flower. Twice she deplored the
      weather, twice criticised the train service on the Great Northern Railway.
      They vigorously assented, and rushed on, and when she inquired whether
      there was any news of Helen, her hostess was too much occupied in placing
      Rothenstein to answer. The question was repeated: &ldquo;I hope that your sister
      is safe in Germany by now.&rdquo; Margaret checked herself and said, &ldquo;Yes, thank
      you; I heard on Tuesday.&rdquo; But the demon of vociferation was in her, and
      the next moment she was off again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only on Tuesday, for they live right away at Stettin. Did you ever know
      any one living at Stettin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never,&rdquo; said Mrs. Wilcox gravely, while her neighbour, a young man low
      down in the Education Office, began to discuss what people who lived at
      Stettin ought to look like. Was there such a thing as Stettininity?
      Margaret swept on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;People at Stettin drop things into boats out of overhanging warehouses.
      At least, our cousins do, but aren&rsquo;t particularly rich. The town isn&rsquo;t
      interesting, except for a clock that rolls its eyes, and the view of the
      Oder, which truly is something special. Oh, Mrs. Wilcox, you would love
      the Oder! The river, or rather rivers&mdash;there seem to be dozens of
      them&mdash;are intense blue, and the plain they run through an intensest
      green.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed! That sounds like a most beautiful view, Miss Schlegel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I say, but Helen, who will muddle things, says no, it&rsquo;s like music.
      The course of the Oder is to be like music. It&rsquo;s obliged to remind her of
      a symphonic poem. The part by the landing-stage is in B minor, if I
      remember rightly, but lower down things get extremely mixed. There is a
      slodgy theme in several keys at once, meaning mud-banks, and another for
      the navigable canal, and the exit into the Baltic is in C sharp major,
      pianissimo.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do the overhanging warehouses make of that?&rdquo; asked the man,
      laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They make a great deal of it,&rdquo; replied Margaret, unexpectedly rushing off
      on a new track. &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s affectation to compare the Oder to music,
      and so do you, but the overhanging warehouses of Stettin take beauty
      seriously, which we don&rsquo;t, and the average Englishman doesn&rsquo;t, and
      despises all who do. Now don&rsquo;t say &lsquo;Germans have no taste,&rsquo; or I shall
      scream. They haven&rsquo;t. But&mdash;but&mdash;such a tremendous but!&mdash;they
      take poetry seriously. They do take poetry seriously.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is anything gained by that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes. The German is always on the lookout for beauty. He may miss it
      through stupidity, or misinterpret it, but he is always asking beauty to
      enter his life, and I believe that in the end it will come. At Heidelberg
      I met a fat veterinary surgeon whose voice broke with sobs as he repeated
      some mawkish poetry. So easy for me to laugh&mdash;I, who never repeat
      poetry, good or bad, and cannot remember one fragment of verse to thrill
      myself with. My blood boils&mdash;well, I&rsquo;m half German, so put it down
      to patriotism&mdash;when I listen to the tasteful contempt of the average
      islander for things Teutonic, whether they&rsquo;re Bocklin or my veterinary
      surgeon. &lsquo;Oh, Bocklin,&rsquo; they say; &lsquo;he strains after beauty, he peoples
      Nature with gods too consciously.&rsquo; Of course Bocklin strains, because he
      wants something&mdash;beauty and all the other intangible gifts that are
      floating about the world. So his landscapes don&rsquo;t come off, and Leader&rsquo;s
      do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not sure that I agree. Do you?&rdquo; said he, turning to Mrs. Wilcox.
    </p>
    <p>
      She replied: &ldquo;I think Miss Schlegel puts everything splendidly;&rdquo; and a
      chill fell on the conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Mrs. Wilcox, say something nicer than that. It&rsquo;s such a snub to be
      told you put things splendidly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not mean it as a snub. Your last speech interested me so much.
      Generally people do not seem quite to like Germany. I have long wanted to
      hear what is said on the other side.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The other side? Then you do disagree. Oh, good! Give us your side.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no side. But my husband&rdquo;&mdash;her voice softened, the chill
      increased&mdash;&ldquo;has very little faith in the Continent, and our children
      have all taken after him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On what grounds? Do they feel that the Continent is in bad form?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Wilcox had no idea; she paid little attention to grounds. She was not
      intellectual, nor even alert, and it was odd that, all the same, she
      should give the idea of greatness. Margaret, zigzagging with her friends
      over Thought and Art, was conscious of a personality that transcended
      their own and dwarfed their activities. There was no bitterness in Mrs.
      Wilcox; there was not even criticism; she was lovable, and no ungracious
      or uncharitable word had passed her lips. Yet she and daily life were out
      of focus; one or the other must show blurred. And at lunch she seemed more
      out of focus than usual, and nearer the line that divides daily life from
      a life that may be of greater importance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will admit, though, that the Continent&mdash;it seems silly to speak
      of &lsquo;the Continent,&rsquo; but really it is all more like itself than any part of
      it is like England. England is unique. Do have another jelly first. I was
      going to say that the Continent, for good or for evil, is interested in
      ideas. Its Literature and Art have what one might call the kink of the
      unseen about them, and this persists even through decadence and
      affectation. There is more liberty of action in England, but for liberty
      of thought go to bureaucratic Prussia. People will there discuss with
      humility vital questions that we here think ourselves too good to touch
      with tongs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not want to go to Prussia,&rdquo; said Mrs. Wilcox &ldquo;not even to see that
      interesting view that you were describing. And for discussing with
      humility I am too old. We never discuss anything at Howards End.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you ought to!&rdquo; said Margaret. &ldquo;Discussion keeps a house alive. It
      cannot stand by bricks and mortar alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It cannot stand without them,&rdquo; said Mrs. Wilcox, unexpectedly catching on
      to the thought, and rousing, for the first and last time, a faint hope in
      the breasts of the delightful people. &ldquo;It cannot stand without them, and I
      sometimes think&mdash;But I cannot expect your generation to agree, for
      even my daughter disagrees with me here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind us or her. Do say!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I sometimes think that it is wiser to leave action and discussion to
      men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a little silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One admits that the arguments against the suffrage ARE extraordinarily
      strong,&rdquo; said a girl opposite, leaning forward and crumbling her bread.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are they? I never follow any arguments. I am only too thankful not to
      have a vote myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t mean the vote, though, did we?&rdquo; supplied Margaret. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t we
      differing on something much wider, Mrs. Wilcox? Whether women are to
      remain what they have been since the dawn of history; or whether, since
      men have moved forward so far, they too may move forward a little now. I
      say they may. I would even admit a biological change.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must be getting back to my overhanging warehouse,&rdquo; said the man.
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve turned disgracefully strict.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Wilcox also rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but come upstairs for a little. Miss Quested plays. Do you like
      MacDowell? Do you mind his only having two noises? If you must really go,
      I&rsquo;ll see you out. Won&rsquo;t you even have coffee?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They left the dining-room closing the door behind them, and as Mrs. Wilcox
      buttoned up her jacket, she said: &ldquo;What an interesting life you all lead
      in London!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, we don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Margaret, with a sudden revulsion. &ldquo;We lead the lives
      of gibbering monkeys. Mrs. Wilcox&mdash;really&mdash;We have something
      quiet and stable at the bottom. We really have. All my friends have. Don&rsquo;t
      pretend you enjoyed lunch, for you loathed it, but forgive me by coming
      again, alone, or by asking me to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am used to young people,&rdquo; said Mrs. Wilcox, and with each word she
      spoke the outlines of known things grew dim. &ldquo;I hear a great deal of
      chatter at home, for we, like you, entertain a great deal. With us it is
      more sport and politics, but&mdash;I enjoyed my lunch very much, Miss
      Schlegel, dear, and am not pretending, and only wish I could have joined
      in more. For one thing, I&rsquo;m not particularly well just to-day. For
      another, you younger people move so quickly that it dazes me. Charles is
      the same, Dolly the same. But we are all in the same boat, old and young.
      I never forget that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were silent for a moment. Then, with a newborn emotion, they shook
      hands. The conversation ceased suddenly when Margaret re-entered the
      dining-room; her friends had been talking over her new friend, and had
      dismissed her as uninteresting.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X
    </h2>
    <p>
      Several days passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was Mrs. Wilcox one of the unsatisfactory people&mdash;there are many of
      them&mdash;who dangle intimacy and then withdraw it? They evoke our
      interests and affections, and keep the life of the spirit dawdling round
      them. Then they withdraw. When physical passion is involved, there is a
      definite name for such behaviour&mdash;flirting&mdash;and if carried far
      enough it is punishable by law. But no law&mdash;not public opinion even&mdash;punishes
      those who coquette with friendship, though the dull ache that they
      inflict, the sense of misdirected effort and exhaustion, may be as
      intolerable. Was she one of these?
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret feared so at first, for, with a Londoner&rsquo;s impatience, she wanted
      everything to be settled up immediately. She mistrusted the periods of
      quiet that are essential to true growth. Desiring to book Mrs. Wilcox as a
      friend, she pressed on the ceremony, pencil, as it were, in hand, pressing
      the more because the rest of the family were away, and the opportunity
      seemed favourable. But the elder woman would not be hurried. She refused
      to fit in with the Wickham Place set, or to reopen discussion of Helen and
      Paul, whom Margaret would have utilised as a short-cut. She took her time,
      or perhaps let time take her, and when the crisis did come all was ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crisis opened with a message: Would Miss Schlegel come shopping?
      Christmas was nearing, and Mrs. Wilcox felt behindhand with the presents.
      She had taken some more days in bed, and must make up for lost time.
      Margaret accepted, and at eleven o&rsquo;clock one cheerless morning they
      started out in a brougham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First of all,&rdquo; began Margaret, &ldquo;we must make a list and tick off the
      people&rsquo;s names. My aunt always does, and this fog may thicken up any
      moment. Have you any ideas?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought we would go to Harrods or the Haymarket Stores,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Wilcox rather hopelessly. &ldquo;Everything is sure to be there. I am not a good
      shopper. The din is so confusing, and your aunt is quite right&mdash;one
      ought to make a list. Take my notebook, then, and write your own name at
      the top of the page.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, hooray!&rdquo; said Margaret, writing it. &ldquo;How very kind of you to start
      with me!&rdquo; But she did not want to receive anything expensive. Their
      acquaintance was singular rather than intimate, and she divined that the
      Wilcox clan would resent any expenditure on outsiders; the more compact
      families do. She did not want to be thought a second Helen, who would
      snatch presents since she could not snatch young men, nor to be exposed
      like a second Aunt Juley, to the insults of Charles. A certain austerity
      of demeanour was best, and she added: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t really want a Yuletide
      gift, though. In fact, I&rsquo;d rather not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I&rsquo;ve odd ideas about Christmas. Because I have all that money can
      buy. I want more people, but no more things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to give you something worth your acquaintance, Miss
      Schlegel, in memory of your kindness to me during my lonely fortnight. It
      has so happened that I have been left alone, and you have stopped me from
      brooding. I am too apt to brood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If that is so,&rdquo; said Margaret, &ldquo;if I have happened to be of use to you,
      which I didn&rsquo;t know, you cannot pay me back with anything tangible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose not, but one would like to. Perhaps I shall think of something
      as we go about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her name remained at the head of the list, but nothing was written
      opposite it. They drove from shop to shop. The air was white, and when
      they alighted it tasted like cold pennies. At times they passed through a
      clot of grey. Mrs. Wilcox&rsquo;s vitality was low that morning, and it was
      Margaret who decided on a horse for this little girl, a golliwog for that,
      for the rector&rsquo;s wife a copper warming-tray. &ldquo;We always give the servants
      money.&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, do you, yes, much easier,&rdquo; replied Margaret but felt the
      grotesque impact of the unseen upon the seen, and saw issuing from a
      forgotten manger at Bethlehem this torrent of coins and toys. Vulgarity
      reigned. Public-houses, besides their usual exhortation against temperance
      reform, invited men to &ldquo;Join our Christmas goose club&rdquo;&mdash;one bottle of
      gin, etc., or two, according to subscription. A poster of a woman in
      tights heralded the Christmas pantomime, and little red devils, who had
      come in again that year, were prevalent upon the Christmas-cards. Margaret
      was no morbid idealist. She did not wish this spate of business and
      self-advertisement checked. It was only the occasion of it that struck her
      with amazement annually. How many of these vacillating shoppers and tired
      shop-assistants realised that it was a divine event that drew them
      together? She realised it, though standing outside in the matter. She was
      not a Christian in the accepted sense; she did not believe that God had
      ever worked among us as a young artisan. These people, or most of them,
      believed it, and if pressed, would affirm it in words. But the visible
      signs of their belief were Regent Street or Drury Lane, a little mud
      displaced, a little money spent, a little food cooked, eaten, and
      forgotten. Inadequate. But in public who shall express the unseen
      adequately? It is private life that holds out the mirror to infinity;
      personal intercourse, and that alone, that ever hints at a personality
      beyond our daily vision.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I do like Christmas on the whole,&rdquo; she announced. &ldquo;In its clumsy way,
      it does approach Peace and Goodwill. But oh, it is clumsier every year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it? I am only used to country Christmases.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are usually in London, and play the game with vigour&mdash;carols at
      the Abbey, clumsy midday meal, clumsy dinner for the maids, followed by
      Christmas-tree and dancing of poor children, with songs from Helen. The
      drawing-room does very well for that. We put the tree in the
      powder-closet, and draw a curtain when the candles are lighted, and with
      the looking-glass behind it looks quite pretty. I wish we might have a
      powder-closet in our next house. Of course, the tree has to be very small,
      and the presents don&rsquo;t hang on it. No; the presents reside in a sort of
      rocky landscape made of crumpled brown paper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You spoke of your &lsquo;next house,&rsquo; Miss Schlegel. Then are you leaving
      Wickham Place?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, in two or three years, when the lease expires. We must.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you been there long?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All our lives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will be very sorry to leave it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose so. We scarcely realise it yet. My father&mdash;&rdquo; She broke
      off, for they had reached the stationery department of the Haymarket
      Stores, and Mrs. Wilcox wanted to order some private greeting cards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If possible, something distinctive,&rdquo; she sighed. At the counter she found
      a friend, bent on the same errand, and conversed with her insipidly,
      wasting much time. &ldquo;My husband and our daughter are motoring.&rdquo; &ldquo;Bertha,
      too? Oh, fancy, what a coincidence!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret, though not practical, could shine in such company as this. While
      they talked, she went through a volume of specimen cards, and submitted
      one for Mrs. Wilcox&rsquo;s inspection. Mrs. Wilcox was delighted&mdash;so
      original, words so sweet; she would order a hundred like that, and could
      never be sufficiently grateful. Then, just as the assistant was booking
      the order, she said: &ldquo;Do you know, I&rsquo;ll wait. On second thoughts, I&rsquo;ll
      wait. There&rsquo;s plenty of time still, isn&rsquo;t there, and I shall be able to
      get Evie&rsquo;s opinion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They returned to the carriage by devious paths; when they were in, she
      said, &ldquo;But couldn&rsquo;t you get it renewed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon?&rdquo; asked Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The lease, I mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the lease! Have you been thinking of that all the time? How very kind
      of you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely something could be done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; values have risen too enormously. They mean to pull down Wickham
      Place, and build flats like yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how horrible!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Landlords are horrible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then she said vehemently: &ldquo;It is monstrous, Miss Schlegel; it isn&rsquo;t right.
      I had no idea that this was hanging over you. I do pity you from the
      bottom of my heart. To be parted from your house, your father&rsquo;s house&mdash;it
      oughtn&rsquo;t to be allowed. It is worse than dying. I would rather die than&mdash;Oh,
      poor girls! Can what they call civilisation be right, if people mayn&rsquo;t die
      in the room where they were born? My dear, I am so sorry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret did not know what to say. Mrs. Wilcox had been overtired by the
      shopping, and was inclined to hysteria.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Howards End was nearly pulled down once. It would have killed me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;Howards End must be a very different house to ours. We are fond
      of ours, but there is nothing distinctive about it. As you saw, it is an
      ordinary London house. We shall easily find another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Again my lack of experience, I suppose!&rdquo; said Margaret, easing away from
      the subject. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say anything when you take up that line, Mrs.
      Wilcox. I wish I could see myself as you see me&mdash;foreshortened into a
      backfisch. Quite the ingenue. Very charming&mdash;wonderfully well read
      for my age, but incapable&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Wilcox would not be deterred. &ldquo;Come down with me to Howards End now,&rdquo;
       she said, more vehemently than ever. &ldquo;I want you to see it. You have never
      seen it. I want to hear what you say about it, for you do put things so
      wonderfully.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret glanced at the pitiless air and then at the tired face of her
      companion. &ldquo;Later on I should love it,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s hardly
      the weather for such an expedition, and we ought to start when we&rsquo;re
      fresh. Isn&rsquo;t the house shut up, too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She received no answer. Mrs. Wilcox appeared to be annoyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Might I come some other day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Wilcox bent forward and tapped the glass. &ldquo;Back to Wickham Place,
      please!&rdquo; was her order to the coachman. Margaret had been snubbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A thousand thanks, Miss Schlegel, for all your help.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is such a comfort to get the presents off my mind&mdash;the
      Christmas-cards especially. I do admire your choice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was her turn to receive no answer. In her turn Margaret became annoyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My husband and Evie will be back the day after to-morrow. That is why I
      dragged you out shopping to-day. I stayed in town chiefly to shop, but got
      through nothing, and now he writes that they must cut their tour short,
      the weather is so bad, and the police-traps have been so bad&mdash;nearly
      as bad as in Surrey. Ours is such a careful chauffeur, and my husband
      feels it particularly hard that they should be treated like road-hogs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, naturally he&mdash;he isn&rsquo;t a road-hog.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was exceeding the speed-limit, I conclude. He must expect to suffer
      with the lower animals.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Wilcox was silenced. In growing discomfort they drove homewards. The
      city seemed Satanic, the narrower streets oppressing like the galleries of
      a mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      No harm was done by the fog to trade, for it lay high, and the lighted
      windows of the shops were thronged with customers. It was rather a
      darkening of the spirit which fell back upon itself, to find a more
      grievous darkness within. Margaret nearly spoke a dozen times, but
      something throttled her. She felt petty and awkward, and her meditations
      on Christmas grew more cynical. Peace? It may bring other gifts, but is
      there a single Londoner to whom Christmas is peaceful? The craving for
      excitement and for elaboration has ruined that blessing. Goodwill? Had she
      seen any example of it in the hordes of purchasers? Or in herself? She had
      failed to respond to this invitation merely because it was a little queer
      and imaginative&mdash;she, whose birthright it was to nourish imagination!
      Better to have accepted, to have tired themselves a little by the journey,
      than coldly to reply, &ldquo;Might I come some other day?&rdquo; Her cynicism left
      her. There would be no other day. This shadowy woman would never ask her
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      They parted at the Mansions. Mrs. Wilcox went in after due civilities, and
      Margaret watched the tall, lonely figure sweep up the hall to the lift. As
      the glass doors closed on it she had the sense of an imprisonment The
      beautiful head disappeared first, still buried in the muff; the long
      trailing skirt followed. A woman of undefinable rarity was going up
      heavenward, like a specimen in a bottle. And into what a heaven&mdash;a
      vault as of hell, sooty black, from which soot descended!
    </p>
    <p>
      At lunch her brother, seeing her inclined for silence insisted on talking.
      Tibby was not ill-natured, but from babyhood something drove him to do the
      unwelcome and the unexpected. Now he gave her a long account of the
      day-school that he sometimes patronised. The account was interesting, and
      she had often pressed him for it before, but she could not attend now, for
      her mind was focussed on the invisible. She discerned that Mrs. Wilcox,
      though a loving wife and mother, had only one passion in life&mdash;her
      house&mdash;and that the moment was solemn when she invited a friend to
      share this passion with her. To answer &ldquo;another day&rdquo; was to answer as a
      fool. &ldquo;Another day&rdquo; will do for brick and mortar, but not for the Holy of
      Holies into which Howards End had been transfigured. Her own curiosity was
      slight. She had heard more than enough about it in the summer. The nine
      windows, the vine, and the wych-elm had no pleasant connections for her,
      and she would have preferred to spend the afternoon at a concert. But
      imagination triumphed. While her brother held forth she determined to go,
      at whatever cost, and to compel Mrs. Wilcox to go, too. When lunch was
      over she stepped over to the flats.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Wilcox had just gone away for the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret said that it was of no consequence, hurried downstairs, and took
      a hansom to King&rsquo;s Cross. She was convinced that the escapade was
      important, though it would have puzzled her to say why. There was question
      of imprisonment and escape, and though she did not know the time of the
      train, she strained her eyes for St. Pancras&rsquo;s clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the clock of King&rsquo;s Cross swung into sight, a second moon in that
      infernal sky, and her cab drew up at the station. There was a train for
      Hilton in five minutes. She took a ticket, asking in her agitation for a
      single. As she did so, a grave and happy voice saluted her and thanked
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will come if I still may,&rdquo; said Margaret, laughing nervously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are coming to sleep, dear, too. It is in the morning that my house is
      most beautiful. You are coming to stop. I cannot show you my meadow
      properly except at sunrise. These fogs&rdquo;&mdash;she pointed at the station
      roof&mdash;&ldquo;never spread far. I dare say they are sitting in the sun in
      Hertfordshire, and you will never repent joining them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall never repent joining you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They began the walk up the long platform. Far at its end stood the train,
      breasting the darkness without. They never reached it. Before imagination
      could triumph, there were cries of &ldquo;Mother! mother!&rdquo; and a heavy-browed
      girl darted out of the cloak-room and seized Mrs. Wilcox by the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Evie!&rdquo; she gasped&mdash;&ldquo;Evie, my pet&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl called, &ldquo;Father! I say! look who&rsquo;s here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Evie, dearest girl, why aren&rsquo;t you in Yorkshire?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;motor smash&mdash;changed plans&mdash;father&rsquo;s coming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Ruth!&rdquo; cried Mr. Wilcox, joining them, &ldquo;what in the name of all
      that&rsquo;s wonderful are you doing here, Ruth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Wilcox had recovered herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Henry dear!&mdash;here&rsquo;s a lovely surprise&mdash;but let me introduce&mdash;but
      I think you know Miss Schlegel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; he replied, not greatly interested. &ldquo;But how&rsquo;s yourself, Ruth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fit as a fiddle,&rdquo; she answered gaily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So are we, and so was our car, which ran A1 as far as Ripon, but there a
      wretched horse and cart which a fool of a driver&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Schlegel, our little outing must be for another day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was saying that this fool of a driver, as the policeman himself
      admits.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another day, Mrs. Wilcox. Of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;But as we&rsquo;ve insured against third party risks, it won&rsquo;t so much
      matter&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;Cart and car being practically at right angles&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The voices of the happy family rose high. Margaret was left alone. No one
      wanted her. Mrs. Wilcox walked out of King&rsquo;s Cross between her husband and
      her daughter, listening to both of them.

      CHAPTER XI
    </h2>
    <p>
      The funeral was over. The carriages had rolled away through the soft mud,
      and only the poor remained. They approached to the newly-dug shaft and
      looked their last at the coffin, now almost hidden beneath the spadefuls
      of clay. It was their moment. Most of them were women from the dead
      woman&rsquo;s district, to whom black garments had been served out by Mr.
      Wilcox&rsquo;s orders. Pure curiosity had brought others. They thrilled with the
      excitement of a death, and of a rapid death, and stood in groups or moved
      between the graves, like drops of ink. The son of one of them, a
      wood-cutter, was perched high above their heads, pollarding one of the
      churchyard elms. From where he sat he could see the village of Hilton,
      strung upon the North Road, with its accreting suburbs; the sunset beyond,
      scarlet and orange, winking at him beneath brows of grey; the church; the
      plantations; and behind him an unspoilt country of fields and farms. But
      he, too, was rolling the event luxuriously in his mouth. He tried to tell
      his mother down below all that he had felt when he saw the coffin
      approaching: how he could not leave his work, and yet did not like to go
      on with it; how he had almost slipped out of the tree, he was so upset;
      the rooks had cawed, and no wonder&mdash;it was as if rooks knew too. His
      mother claimed the prophetic power herself&mdash;she had seen a strange
      look about Mrs. Wilcox for some time. London had done the mischief, said
      others. She had been a kind lady; her grandmother had been kind, too&mdash;a
      plainer person, but very kind. Ah, the old sort was dying out! Mr. Wilcox,
      he was a kind gentleman. They advanced to the topic again and again,
      dully, but with exaltation. The funeral of a rich person was to them what
      the funeral of Alcestis or Ophelia is to the educated. It was Art; though
      remote from life, it enhanced life&rsquo;s values, and they witnessed it avidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The grave-diggers, who had kept up an undercurrent of disapproval&mdash;they
      disliked Charles; it was not a moment to speak of such things, but they
      did not like Charles Wilcox&mdash;the grave-diggers finished their work
      and piled up the wreaths and crosses above it. The sun set over Hilton;
      the grey brows of the evening flushed a little, and were cleft with one
      scarlet frown. Chattering sadly to each other, the mourners passed through
      the lych-gate and traversed the chestnut avenues that led down to the
      village. The young wood-cutter stayed a little longer, poised above the
      silence and swaying rhythmically. At last the bough fell beneath his saw.
      With a grunt, he descended, his thoughts dwelling no longer on death, but
      on love, for he was mating. He stopped as he passed the new grave; a sheaf
      of tawny chrysanthemums had caught his eye. &ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t ought to have
      coloured flowers at buryings,&rdquo; he reflected. Trudging on a few steps, he
      stopped again, looked furtively at the dusk, turned back, wrenched a
      chrysanthemum from the sheaf, and hid it in his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      After him came silence absolute. The cottage that abutted on the
      churchyard was empty, and no other house stood near. Hour after hour the
      scene of the interment remained without an eye to witness it. Clouds
      drifted over it from the west; or the church may have been a ship,
      high-prowed, steering with all its company towards infinity. Towards
      morning the air grew colder, the sky clearer, the surface of the earth
      hard and sparkling above the prostrate dead. The wood-cutter, returning
      after a night of joy, reflected: &ldquo;They lilies, they chrysants; it&rsquo;s a pity
      I didn&rsquo;t take them all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Up at Howards End they were attempting breakfast. Charles and Evie sat in
      the dining-room, with Mrs. Charles. Their father, who could not bear to
      see a face, breakfasted upstairs. He suffered acutely. Pain came over him
      in spasms, as if it was physical, and even while he was about to eat, his
      eyes would fill with tears, and he would lay down the morsel untasted.
    </p>
    <p>
      He remembered his wife&rsquo;s even goodness during thirty years. Not anything
      in detail&mdash;not courtship or early raptures&mdash;but just the
      unvarying virtue, that seemed to him a woman&rsquo;s noblest quality. So many
      women are capricious, breaking into odd flaws of passion or frivolity. Not
      so his wife. Year after year, summer and winter, as bride and mother, she
      had been the same, he had always trusted her. Her tenderness! Her
      innocence! The wonderful innocence that was hers by the gift of God. Ruth
      knew no more of worldly wickedness and wisdom than did the flowers in her
      garden, or the grass in her field. Her idea of business&mdash;&ldquo;Henry, why
      do people who have enough money try to get more money?&rdquo; Her idea of
      politics&mdash;&ldquo;I am sure that if the mothers of various nations could
      meet, there would be no more wars,&rdquo; Her idea of religion&mdash;ah, this
      had been a cloud, but a cloud that passed. She came of Quaker stock, and
      he and his family, formerly Dissenters, were now members of the Church of
      England. The rector&rsquo;s sermons had at first repelled her, and she had
      expressed a desire for &ldquo;a more inward light,&rdquo; adding, &ldquo;not so much for
      myself as for baby&rdquo; (Charles). Inward light must have been granted, for he
      heard no complaints in later years. They brought up their three children
      without dispute. They had never disputed.
    </p>
    <p>
      She lay under the earth now. She had gone, and as if to make her going the
      more bitter, had gone with a touch of mystery that was all unlike her.
      &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me you knew of it?&rdquo; he had moaned, and her faint
      voice had answered: &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to, Henry&mdash;I might have been wrong&mdash;and
      every one hates illnesses.&rdquo; He had been told of the horror by a strange
      doctor, whom she had consulted during his absence from town. Was this
      altogether just? Without fully explaining, she had died. It was a fault on
      her part, and&mdash;tears rushed into his eyes&mdash;what a little fault!
      It was the only time she had deceived him in those thirty years.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose to his feet and looked out of the window, for Evie had come in
      with the letters, and he could meet no one&rsquo;s eye. Ah yes&mdash;she had
      been a good woman&mdash;she had been steady. He chose the word
      deliberately. To him steadiness included all praise. He himself, gazing at
      the wintry garden, is in appearance a steady man. His face was not as
      square as his son&rsquo;s, and, indeed, the chin, though firm enough in outline,
      retreated a little, and the lips, ambiguous, were curtained by a
      moustache. But there was no external hint of weakness. The eyes, if
      capable of kindness and good-fellowship, if ruddy for the moment with
      tears, were the eyes of one who could not be driven. The forehead, too,
      was like Charles&rsquo;s. High and straight, brown and polished, merging
      abruptly into temples and skull, it had the effect of a bastion that
      protected his head from the world. At times it had the effect of a blank
      wall. He had dwelt behind it, intact and happy, for fifty years. &ldquo;The
      post&rsquo;s come, father,&rdquo; said Evie awkwardly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks. Put it down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has the breakfast been all right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, thanks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl glanced at him and at it with constraint. She did not know what
      to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Charles says do you want the Times?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ll read it later.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ring if you want anything, father, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve all I want.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having sorted the letters from the circulars, she went back to the
      dining-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father&rsquo;s eaten nothing,&rdquo; she announced, sitting down with wrinkled brows
      behind the tea-urn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charles did not answer, but after a moment he ran quickly upstairs, opened
      the door, and said &ldquo;Look here father, you must eat, you know;&rdquo; and having
      paused for a reply that did not come, stole down again. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s going to
      read his letters first, I think,&rdquo; he said evasively; &ldquo;I dare say he will
      go on with his breakfast afterwards.&rdquo; Then he took up the Times, and for
      some time there was no sound except the clink of cup against saucer and of
      knife on plate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Mrs. Charles sat between her silent companions terrified at the
      course of events, and a little bored. She was a rubbishy little creature,
      and she knew it. A telegram had dragged her from Naples to the death-bed
      of a woman whom she had scarcely known. A word from her husband had
      plunged her into mourning. She desired to mourn inwardly as well, but she
      wished that Mrs. Wilcox, since fated to die, could have died before the
      marriage, for then less would have been expected of her. Crumbling her
      toast, and too nervous to ask for the butter, she remained almost
      motionless, thankful only for this, that her father-in-law was having his
      breakfast upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last Charles spoke. &ldquo;They had no business to be pollarding those elms
      yesterday,&rdquo; he said to his sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must make a note of that,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;I am surprised that the
      rector allowed it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps it may not be the rector&rsquo;s affair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whose else could it be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The lord of the manor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Butter, Dolly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Evie dear. Charles&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know one could pollard elms. I thought one only pollarded
      willows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no, one can pollard elms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why oughtn&rsquo;t the elms in the churchyard to be pollarded?&rdquo; Charles
      frowned a little, and turned again to his sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another point. I must speak to Chalkeley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, rather; you must complain to Chalkeley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no good his saying he is not responsible for those men. He is
      responsible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, rather.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brother and sister were not callous. They spoke thus, partly because they
      desired to keep Chalkeley up to the mark&mdash;a healthy desire in its way&mdash;partly
      because they avoided the personal note in life. All Wilcoxes did. It did
      not seem to them of supreme importance. Or it may be as Helen supposed:
      they realised its importance, but were afraid of it. Panic and emptiness,
      could one glance behind. They were not callous, and they left the
      breakfast-table with aching hearts. Their mother never had come in to
      breakfast. It was in the other rooms, and especially in the garden, that
      they felt her loss most. As Charles went out to the garage, he was
      reminded at every step of the woman who had loved him and whom he could
      never replace. What battles he had fought against her gentle conservatism!
      How she had disliked improvements, yet how loyally she had accepted them
      when made! He and his father&mdash;what trouble they had had to get this
      very garage! With what difficulty had they persuaded her to yield them the
      paddock for it&mdash;the paddock that she loved more dearly than the
      garden itself! The vine&mdash;she had got her way about the vine. It still
      encumbered the south wall with its unproductive branches. And so with
      Evie, as she stood talking to the cook. Though she could take up her
      mother&rsquo;s work inside the house, just as the man could take it up without,
      she felt that something unique had fallen out of her life. Their grief,
      though less poignant than their father&rsquo;s, grew from deeper roots, for a
      wife may be replaced; a mother never. Charles would go back to the office.
      There was little at Howards End. The contents of his mother&rsquo;s will had
      long been known to them. There were no legacies, no annuities, none of the
      posthumous bustle with which some of the dead prolong their activities.
      Trusting her husband, she had left him everything without reserve. She was
      quite a poor woman&mdash;the house had been all her dowry, and the house
      would come to Charles in time. Her watercolours Mr. Wilcox intended to
      reserve for Paul, while Evie would take the jewellery and lace. How easily
      she slipped out of life! Charles thought the habit laudable, though he did
      not intend to adopt it himself, whereas Margaret would have seen in it an
      almost culpable indifference to earthly fame. Cynicism&mdash;not the
      superficial cynicism that snarls and sneers, but the cynicism that can go
      with courtesy and tenderness&mdash;that was the note of Mrs. Wilcox&rsquo;s
      will. She wanted not to vex people. That accomplished, the earth might
      freeze over her for ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, there was nothing for Charles to wait for. He could not go on with his
      honeymoon, so he would go up to London and work&mdash;he felt too
      miserable hanging about. He and Dolly would have the furnished flat while
      his father rested quietly in the country with Evie. He could also keep an
      eye on his own little house, which was being painted and decorated for him
      in one of the Surrey suburbs, and in which he hoped to install himself
      soon after Christmas. Yes, he would go up after lunch in his new motor,
      and the town servants, who had come down for the funeral, would go up by
      train.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found his father&rsquo;s chauffeur in the garage, said &ldquo;Morning&rdquo; without
      looking at the man&rsquo;s face, and bending over the car, continued: &ldquo;Hullo! my
      new car&rsquo;s been driven!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has it, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Charles, getting rather red; &ldquo;and whoever&rsquo;s driven it hasn&rsquo;t
      cleaned it properly, for there&rsquo;s mud on the axle. Take it off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man went for the cloths without a word. He was a chauffeur as ugly as
      sin&mdash;not that this did him disservice with Charles, who thought charm
      in a man rather rot, and had soon got rid of the little Italian beast with
      whom they had started.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Charles&mdash;&rdquo; His bride was tripping after him over the hoar-frost, a
      dainty black column, her little face and elaborate mourning hat forming
      the capital thereof.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One minute, I&rsquo;m busy. Well, Crane, who&rsquo;s been driving it, do you
      suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m sure, sir. No one&rsquo;s driven it since I&rsquo;ve been back, but,
      of course, there&rsquo;s the fortnight I&rsquo;ve been away with the other car in
      Yorkshire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mud came off easily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Charles, your father&rsquo;s down. Something&rsquo;s happened. He wants you in the
      house at once. Oh, Charles!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait, dear, wait a minute. Who had the key of the garage while you were
      away, Crane?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The gardener, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to tell me that old Penny can drive a motor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir; no one&rsquo;s had the motor out, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then how do you account for the mud on the axle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t, of course, say for the time I&rsquo;ve been in Yorkshire. No more mud
      now, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Charles was vexed. The man was treating him as a fool, and if his heart
      had not been so heavy he would have reported him to his father. But it was
      not a morning for complaints. Ordering the motor to be round after lunch,
      he joined his wife, who had all the while been pouring out some incoherent
      story about a letter and a Miss Schlegel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Dolly, I can attend to you. Miss Schlegel? What does she want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When people wrote a letter Charles always asked what they wanted. Want was
      to him the only cause of action. And the question in this case was
      correct, for his wife replied, &ldquo;She wants Howards End.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Howards End? Now, Crane, just don&rsquo;t forget to put on the Stepney wheel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, mind you don&rsquo;t forget, for I&mdash;Come, little woman.&rdquo; When they
      were out of the chauffeur&rsquo;s sight he put his arm round her waist and
      pressed her against him. All his affection and half his attention&mdash;it
      was what he granted her throughout their happy married life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you haven&rsquo;t listened, Charles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I keep on telling you&mdash;Howards End. Miss Schlegel&rsquo;s got it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Got what?&rdquo; said Charles, unclasping her. &ldquo;What the dickens are you
      talking about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Charles, you promised not so say those naughty&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, I&rsquo;m in no mood for foolery. It&rsquo;s no morning for it either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you&mdash;I keep on telling you&mdash;Miss Schlegel&mdash;she&rsquo;s
      got it&mdash;your mother&rsquo;s left it to her&mdash;and you&rsquo;ve all got to move
      out!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;HOWARDS END?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;HOWARDS END!&rdquo; she screamed, mimicking him, and as she did so Evie came
      dashing out of the shubbery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dolly, go back at once! My father&rsquo;s much annoyed with you. Charles&rdquo;&mdash;she
      hit herself wildly&mdash;&ldquo;come in at once to father. He&rsquo;s had a letter
      that&rsquo;s too awful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Charles began to run, but checked himself, and stepped heavily across the
      gravel path. There the house was with the nine windows, the unprolific
      vine. He exclaimed, &ldquo;Schlegels again!&rdquo; and as if to complete chaos, Dolly
      said, &ldquo;Oh no, the matron of the nursing home has written instead of her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in, all three of you!&rdquo; cried his father, no longer inert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dolly, why have you disobeyed me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Mr. Wilcox&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you not to go out to the garage. I&rsquo;ve heard you all shouting in
      the garden. I won&rsquo;t have it. Come in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stood in the porch, transformed, letters in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Into the dining-room, every one of you. We can&rsquo;t discuss private matters
      in the middle of all the servants. Here, Charles, here; read these. See
      what you make.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Charles took two letters, and read them as he followed the procession. The
      first was a covering note from the matron. Mrs. Wilcox had desired her,
      when the funeral should be over, to forward the enclosed. The enclosed&mdash;it
      was from his mother herself. She had written: &ldquo;To my husband: I should
      like Miss Schlegel (Margaret) to have Howards End.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose we&rsquo;re going to have a talk about this?&rdquo; he remarked, ominously
      calm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. I was coming out to you when Dolly&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s sit down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Evie, don&rsquo;t waste time, sit&mdash;down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In silence they drew up to the breakfast-table. The events of yesterday&mdash;indeed,
      of this morning suddenly receded into a past so remote that they seemed
      scarcely to have lived in it. Heavy breathings were heard. They were
      calming themselves. Charles, to steady them further, read the enclosure
      out loud: &ldquo;A note in my mother&rsquo;s handwriting, in an envelope addressed to
      my father, sealed. Inside: &lsquo;I should like Miss Schlegel (Margaret) to have
      Howards End.&rsquo; No date, no signature. Forwarded through the matron of that
      nursing home. Now, the question is&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dolly interrupted him. &ldquo;But I say that note isn&rsquo;t legal. Houses ought to
      be done by a lawyer, Charles, surely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her husband worked his jaw severely. Little lumps appeared in front of
      either ear&mdash;a symptom that she had not yet learnt to respect, and she
      asked whether she might see the note. Charles looked at his father for
      permission, who said abstractedly, &ldquo;Give it her.&rdquo; She seized it, and at
      once exclaimed: &ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s only in pencil! I said so. Pencil never
      counts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We know that it is not legally binding, Dolly,&rdquo; said Mr. Wilcox, speaking
      from out of his fortress. &ldquo;We are aware of that. Legally, I should be
      justified in tearing it up and throwing it into the fire. Of course, my
      dear, we consider you as one of the family, but it will be better if you
      do not interfere with what you do not understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Charles, vexed both with his father and his wife, then repeated: &ldquo;The
      question is&mdash;&rdquo; He had cleared a space of the breakfast-table from
      plates and knives, so that he could draw patterns on the tablecloth. &ldquo;The
      question is whether Miss Schlegel, during the fortnight we were all away,
      whether she unduly&mdash;&rdquo; He stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that,&rdquo; said his father, whose nature was nobler than his
      son&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That she would have&mdash;that it is a case of undue influence. No, to my
      mind the question is the&mdash;the invalid&rsquo;s condition at the time she
      wrote.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear father, consult an expert if you like, but I don&rsquo;t admit it is my
      mother&rsquo;s writing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you just said it was!&rdquo; cried Dolly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind if I did,&rdquo; he blazed out; &ldquo;and hold your tongue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The poor little wife coloured at this, and, drawing her handkerchief from
      her pocket, shed a few tears. No one noticed her. Evie was scowling like
      an angry boy. The two men were gradually assuming the manner of the
      committee-room. They were both at their best when serving on committees.
      They did not make the mistake of handling human affairs in the bulk, but
      disposed of them item by item, sharply. Caligraphy was the item before
      them now, and on it they turned their well-trained brains. Charles, after
      a little demur, accepted the writing as genuine, and they passed on to the
      next point. It is the best&mdash;perhaps the only&mdash;way of dodging
      emotion. They were the average human article, and had they considered the
      note as a whole it would have driven them miserable or mad. Considered
      item by item, the emotional content was minimised, and all went forward
      smoothly. The clock ticked, the coals blazed higher, and contended with
      the white radiance that poured in through the windows. Unnoticed, the sun
      occupied his sky, and the shadows of the tree stems, extraordinarily
      solid, fell like trenches of purple across the frosted lawn. It was a
      glorious winter morning. Evie&rsquo;s fox terrier, who had passed for white, was
      only a dirty grey dog now, so intense was the purity that surrounded him.
      He was discredited, but the blackbirds that he was chasing glowed with
      Arabian darkness, for all the conventional colouring of life had been
      altered. Inside, the clock struck ten with a rich and confident note.
      Other clocks confirmed it, and the discussion moved towards its close.
    </p>
    <p>
      To follow it is unnecessary. It is rather a moment when the commentator
      should step forward. Ought the Wilcoxes to have offered their home to
      Margaret? I think not. The appeal was too flimsy. It was not legal; it had
      been written in illness, and under the spell of a sudden friendship; it
      was contrary to the dead woman&rsquo;s intentions in the past, contrary to her
      very nature, so far as that nature was understood by them. To them Howards
      End was a house: they could not know that to her it had been a spirit, for
      which she sought a spiritual heir. And&mdash;pushing one step farther in
      these mists&mdash;may they not have decided even better than they
      supposed? Is it credible that the possessions of the spirit can be
      bequeathed at all? Has the soul offspring? A wych-elm tree, a vine, a wisp
      of hay with dew on it&mdash;can passion for such things be transmitted
      where there is no bond of blood? No; the Wilcoxes are not to be blamed.
      The problem is too terrific, and they could not even perceive a problem.
      No; it is natural and fitting that after due debate they should tear the
      note up and throw it on to their dining-room fire. The practical moralist
      may acquit them absolutely. He who strives to look deeper may acquit them&mdash;almost.
      For one hard fact remains. They did neglect a personal appeal. The woman
      who had died did say to them, &ldquo;Do this,&rdquo; and they answered, &ldquo;We will not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The incident made a most painful impression on them. Grief mounted into
      the brain and worked there disquietingly. Yesterday they had lamented:
      &ldquo;She was a dear mother, a true wife; in our absence she neglected her
      health and died.&rdquo; To-day they thought: &ldquo;She was not as true, as dear, as
      we supposed.&rdquo; The desire for a more inward light had found expression at
      last, the unseen had impacted on the seen, and all that they could say was
      &ldquo;Treachery.&rdquo; Mrs. Wilcox had been treacherous to the family, to the laws
      of property, to her own written word. How did she expect Howards End to be
      conveyed to Miss Schlegel? Was her husband, to whom it legally belonged,
      to make it over to her as a free gift? Was the said Miss Schlegel to have
      a life interest in it, or to own it absolutely? Was there to be no
      compensation for the garage and other improvements that they had made
      under the assumption that all would be theirs some day? Treacherous!
      treacherous and absurd! When we think the dead both treacherous and
      absurd, we have gone far towards reconciling ourselves to their departure.
      That note, scribbled in pencil, sent through the matron, was
      unbusinesslike as well as cruel, and decreased at once the value of the
      woman who had written it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, well!&rdquo; said Mr. Wilcox, rising from the table. &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t have
      thought it possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother couldn&rsquo;t have meant it,&rdquo; said Evie, still frowning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my girl, of course not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother believed so in ancestors too&mdash;it isn&rsquo;t like her to leave
      anything to an outsider, who&rsquo;d never appreciate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The whole thing is unlike her,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;If Miss Schlegel had been
      poor, if she had wanted a house, I could understand it a little. But she
      has a house of her own. Why should she want another? She wouldn&rsquo;t have any
      use for Howards End.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That time may prove,&rdquo; murmured Charles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How?&rdquo; asked his sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Presumably she knows&mdash;mother will have told her. She got twice or
      three times into the nursing home. Presumably she is awaiting
      developments.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a horrid woman!&rdquo; And Dolly, who had recovered, cried, &ldquo;Why, she may
      be coming down to turn us out now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Charles put her right. &ldquo;I wish she would,&rdquo; he said ominously. &ldquo;I could
      then deal with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So could I,&rdquo; echoed his father, who was feeling rather in the cold.
      Charles had been kind in undertaking the funeral arrangements and in
      telling him to eat his breakfast, but the boy as he grew up was a little
      dictatorial, and assumed the post of chairman too readily. &ldquo;I could deal
      with her, if she comes, but she won&rsquo;t come. You&rsquo;re all a bit hard on Miss
      Schlegel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That Paul business was pretty scandalous, though.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want no more of the Paul business, Charles, as I said at the time, and
      besides, it is quite apart from this business. Margaret Schlegel has been
      officious and tiresome during this terrible week, and we have all suffered
      under her, but upon my soul she&rsquo;s honest. She&rsquo;s NOT in collusion with the
      matron. I&rsquo;m absolutely certain of it. Nor was she with the doctor, I&rsquo;m
      equally certain of that. She did not hide anything from us, for up to that
      very afternoon she was as ignorant as we are. She, like ourselves, was a
      dupe&mdash;&rdquo; He stopped for a moment. &ldquo;You see, Charles, in her terrible
      pain your mother put us all in false positions. Paul would not have left
      England, you would not have gone to Italy, nor Evie and I into Yorkshire,
      if only we had known. Well, Miss Schlegel&rsquo;s position has been equally
      false. Take all in all, she has not come out of it badly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Evie said: &ldquo;But those chrysanthemums&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or coming down to the funeral at all&mdash;&rdquo; echoed Dolly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t she come down? She had the right to, and she stood far back
      among the Hilton women. The flowers&mdash;certainly we should not have
      sent such flowers, but they may have seemed the right thing to her, Evie,
      and for all you know they may be the custom in Germany.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I forget she isn&rsquo;t really English,&rdquo; cried Evie. &ldquo;That would explain a
      lot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a cosmopolitan,&rdquo; said Charles, looking at his watch. &ldquo;I admit I&rsquo;m
      rather down on cosmopolitans. My fault, doubtless. I cannot stand them,
      and a German cosmopolitan is the limit. I think that&rsquo;s about all, isn&rsquo;t
      it? I want to run down and see Chalkeley. A bicycle will do. And, by the
      way, I wish you&rsquo;d speak to Crane some time. I&rsquo;m certain he&rsquo;s had my new
      car out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has he done it any harm?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case I shall let it pass. It&rsquo;s not worth while having a row.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Charles and his father sometimes disagreed. But they always parted with an
      increased regard for one another, and each desired no doughtier comrade
      when it was necessary to voyage for a little past the emotions. So the
      sailors of Ulysses voyaged past the Sirens, having first stopped one
      another&rsquo;s ears with wool.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Charles need not have been anxious. Miss Schlegel had never heard of his
      mother&rsquo;s strange request. She was to hear of it in after years, when she
      had built up her life differently, and it was to fit into position as the
      headstone of the corner. Her mind was bent on other questions now, and by
      her also it would have been rejected as the fantasy of an invalid.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was parting from these Wilcoxes for the second time. Paul and his
      mother, ripple and great wave, had flowed into her life and ebbed out of
      it for ever. The ripple had left no traces behind; the wave had strewn at
      her feet fragments torn from the unknown. A curious seeker, she stood for
      a while at the verge of the sea that tells so little, but tells a little,
      and watched the outgoing of this last tremendous tide. Her friend had
      vanished in agony, but not, she believed, in degradation. Her withdrawal
      had hinted at other things besides disease and pain. Some leave our life
      with tears, others with an insane frigidity; Mrs. Wilcox had taken the
      middle course, which only rarer natures can pursue. She had kept
      proportion. She had told a little of her grim secret to her friends, but
      not too much; she had shut up her heart&mdash;almost, but not entirely. It
      is thus, if there is any rule, that we ought to die&mdash;neither as
      victim nor as fanatic, but as the seafarer who can greet with an equal eye
      the deep that he is entering, and the shore that he must leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last word&mdash;whatever it would be&mdash;had certainly not been said
      in Hilton churchyard. She had not died there. A funeral is not death, any
      more than baptism is birth or marriage union. All three are the clumsy
      devices, coming now too late, now too early, by which Society would
      register the quick motions of man. In Margaret&rsquo;s eyes Mrs. Wilcox had
      escaped registration. She had gone out of life vividly, her own way, and
      no dust was so truly dust as the contents of that heavy coffin, lowered
      with ceremonial until it rested on the dust of the earth, no flowers so
      utterly wasted as the chrysanthemums that the frost must have withered
      before morning. Margaret had once said she &ldquo;loved superstition.&rdquo; It was
      not true. Few women had tried more earnestly to pierce the accretions in
      which body and soul are enwrapped. The death of Mrs. Wilcox had helped her
      in her work. She saw a little more clearly than hitherto what a human
      being is, and to what he may aspire. Truer relationships gleamed. Perhaps
      the last word would be hope&mdash;hope even on this side of the grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, she could take an interest in the survivors. In spite of her
      Christmas duties, in spite of her brother, the Wilcoxes continued to play
      a considerable part in her thoughts. She had seen so much of them in the
      final week. They were not &ldquo;her sort,&rdquo; they were often suspicious and
      stupid, and deficient where she excelled; but collision with them
      stimulated her, and she felt an interest that verged into liking, even for
      Charles. She desired to protect them, and often felt that they could
      protect her, excelling where she was deficient. Once past the rocks of
      emotion, they knew so well what to do, whom to send for; their hands were
      on all the ropes, they had grit as well as grittiness and she valued grit
      enormously. They led a life that she could not attain to&mdash;the outer
      life of &ldquo;telegrams and anger,&rdquo; which had detonated when Helen and Paul had
      touched in June, and had detonated again the other week. To Margaret this
      life was to remain a real force. She could not despise it, as Helen and
      Tibby affected to do. It fostered such virtues as neatness, decision, and
      obedience, virtues of the second rank, no doubt, but they have formed our
      civilisation. They form character, too; Margaret could not doubt it; they
      keep the soul from becoming sloppy. How dare Schlegels despise Wilcoxes,
      when it takes all sorts to make a world?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t brood too much,&rdquo; she wrote to Helen, &ldquo;on the superiority of the
      unseen to the seen. It&rsquo;s true, but to brood on it is medieval. Our
      business is not to contrast the two, but to reconcile them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen replied that she had no intention of brooding on such a dull
      subject. What did her sister take her for? The weather was magnificent.
      She and the Mosebachs had gone tobogganing on the only hill that Pomerania
      boasted. It was fun, but over-crowded, for the rest of Pomerania had gone
      there too. Helen loved the country, and her letter glowed with physical
      exercise and poetry. She spoke of the scenery, quiet, yet august; of the
      snow-clad fields, with their scampering herds of deer; of the river and
      its quaint entrance into the Baltic Sea; of the Oderberge, only three
      hundred feet high, from which one slid all too quickly back into the
      Pomeranian plains, and yet these Oderberge were real mountains, with
      pine-forests, streams, and views complete. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t size that counts so
      much as the way things are arranged.&rdquo; In another paragraph she referred to
      Mrs. Wilcox sympathetically, but the news had not bitten into her. She had
      not realised the accessories of death, which are in a sense more memorable
      than death itself. The atmosphere of precautions and recriminations, and
      in the midst a human body growing more vivid because it was in pain; the
      end of that body in Hilton churchyard; the survival of something that
      suggested hope, vivid in its turn against life&rsquo;s workaday cheerfulness;&mdash;all
      these were lost to Helen, who only felt that a pleasant lady could now be
      pleasant no longer. She returned to Wickham Place full of her own affairs&mdash;she
      had had another proposal&mdash;and Margaret, after a moment&rsquo;s hesitation,
      was content that this should be so.
    </p>
    <p>
      The proposal had not been a serious matter. It was the work of Fraulein
      Mosebach, who had conceived the large and patriotic notion of winning back
      her cousins to the Fatherland by matrimony. England had played Paul
      Wilcox, and lost; Germany played Herr Forstmeister some one&mdash;Helen
      could not remember his name. Herr Forstmeister lived in a wood, and,
      standing on the summit of the Oderberge, he had pointed out his house to
      Helen, or rather, had pointed out the wedge of pines in which it lay. She
      had exclaimed, &ldquo;Oh, how lovely! That&rsquo;s the place for me!&rdquo; and in the
      evening Frieda appeared in her bedroom. &ldquo;I have a message, dear Helen,&rdquo;
       etc., and so she had, but had been very nice when Helen laughed; quite
      understood&mdash;a forest too solitary and damp&mdash;quite agreed, but
      Herr Forstmeister believed he had assurance to the contrary. Germany had
      lost, but with good-humour; holding the manhood of the world, she felt
      bound to win. &ldquo;And there will even be some one for Tibby,&rdquo; concluded
      Helen. &ldquo;There now, Tibby, think of that; Frieda is saving up a little girl
      for you, in pig-tails and white worsted stockings but the feet of the
      stockings are pink as if the little girl had trodden in strawberries. I&rsquo;ve
      talked too much. My head aches. Now you talk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tibby consented to talk. He too was full of his own affairs, for he had
      just been up to try for a scholarship at Oxford. The men were down, and
      the candidates had been housed in various colleges, and had dined in hall.
      Tibby was sensitive to beauty, the experience was new, and he gave a
      description of his visit that was almost glowing. The august and mellow
      University, soaked with the richness of the western counties that it has
      served for a thousand years, appealed at once to the boy&rsquo;s taste; it was
      the kind of thing he could understand, and he understood it all the better
      because it was empty. Oxford is&mdash;Oxford; not a mere receptacle for
      youth, like Cambridge. Perhaps it wants its inmates to love it rather than
      to love one another; such at all events was to be its effect on Tibby. His
      sisters sent him there that he might make friends, for they knew that his
      education had been cranky, and had severed him from other boys and men. He
      made no friends. His Oxford remained Oxford empty, and he took into life
      with him, not the memory of a radiance, but the memory of a colour scheme.
    </p>
    <p>
      It pleased Margaret to hear her brother and sister talking. They did not
      get on overwell as a rule. For a few moments she listened to them, feeling
      elderly and benign.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then something occurred to her, and she interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Helen, I told you about poor Mrs. Wilcox; that sad business?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have had a correspondence with her son. He was winding up the estate,
      and wrote to ask me whether his mother had wanted me to have anything. I
      thought it good of him, considering I knew her so little. I said that she
      had once spoken of giving me a Christmas present, but we both forgot about
      it afterwards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope Charles took the hint.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;that is to say, her husband wrote later on, and thanked me for
      being a little kind to her, and actually gave me her silver vinaigrette.
      Don&rsquo;t you think that is extraordinarily generous? It has made me like him
      very much. He hopes that this will not be the end of our acquaintance, but
      that you and I will go and stop with Evie some time in the future. I like
      Mr. Wilcox. He is taking up his work&mdash;rubber&mdash;it is a big
      business. I gather he is launching out rather. Charles is in it, too.
      Charles is married&mdash;a pretty little creature, but she doesn&rsquo;t seem
      wise. They took on the flat, but now they have gone off to a house of
      their own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen, after a decent pause, continued her account of Stettin. How quickly
      a situation changes! In June she had been in a crisis; even in November
      she could blush and be unnatural; now it was January and the whole affair
      lay forgotten. Looking back on the past six months, Margaret realised the
      chaotic nature of our daily life, and its difference from the orderly
      sequence that has been fabricated by historians. Actual life is full of
      false clues and sign-posts that lead nowhere. With infinite effort we
      nerve ourselves for a crisis that never comes. The most successful career
      must show a waste of strength that might have removed mountains, and the
      most unsuccessful is not that of the man who is taken unprepared, but of
      him who has prepared and is never taken. On a tragedy of that kind our
      national morality is duly silent. It assumes that preparation against
      danger is in itself a good, and that men, like nations, are the better for
      staggering through life fully armed. The tragedy of preparedness has
      scarcely been handled, save by the Greeks. Life is indeed dangerous, but
      not in the way morality would have us believe. It is indeed unmanageable,
      but the essence of it is not a battle. It is unmanageable because it is a
      romance, and its essence is romantic beauty. Margaret hoped that for the
      future she would be less cautious, not more cautious, than she had been in
      the past.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Over two years passed, and the Schlegel household continued to lead its
      life of cultured, but not ignoble, ease, still swimming gracefully on the
      grey tides of London. Concerts and plays swept past them, money had been
      spent and renewed, reputations won and lost, and the city herself,
      emblematic of their lives, rose and fell in a continual flux, while her
      shallows washed more widely against the hills of Surrey and over the
      fields of Hertfordshire. This famous building had arisen, that was doomed.
      To-day Whitehall had been transformed; it would be the turn of Regent
      Street to-morrow. And month by month the roads smelt more strongly of
      petrol, and were more difficult to cross, and human beings heard each
      other speak with greater difficulty, breathed less of the air, and saw
      less of the sky. Nature withdrew; the leaves were falling by midsummer;
      the sun shone through dirt with an admired obscurity.
    </p>
    <p>
      To speak against London is no longer fashionable. The Earth as an artistic
      cult has had its day, and the literature of the near future will probably
      ignore the country and seek inspiration from the town. One can understand
      the reaction. Of Pan and the elemental forces, the public has heard a
      little too much&mdash;they seem Victorian, while London is Georgian&mdash;and
      those who care for the earth with sincerity may wait long ere the pendulum
      swings back to her again. Certainly London fascinates. One visualises it
      as a tract of quivering grey, intelligent without purpose, and excitable
      without love; as a spirit that has altered before it can be chronicled; as
      a heart that certainly beats, but with no pulsation of humanity. It lies
      beyond everything; Nature, with all her cruelty, comes nearer to us than
      do these crowds of men. A friend explains himself; the earth is explicable&mdash;from
      her we came, and we must return to her. But who can explain Westminster
      Bridge Road or Liverpool Street in the morning&mdash;the city inhaling&mdash;or
      the same thoroughfares in the evening&mdash;the city exhaling her
      exhausted air? We reach in desperation beyond the fog, beyond the very
      stars, the voids of the universe are ransacked to justify the monster, and
      stamped with a human face. London is religion&rsquo;s opportunity&mdash;not the
      decorous religion of theologians, but anthropomorphic, crude. Yes, the
      continuous flow would be tolerable if a man of our own sort&mdash;not any
      one pompous or tearful&mdash;were caring for us up in the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Londoner seldom understands his city until it sweeps him, too, away
      from his moorings, and Margaret&rsquo;s eyes were not opened until the lease of
      Wickham Place expired. She had always known that it must expire, but the
      knowledge only became vivid about nine months before the event. Then the
      house was suddenly ringed with pathos. It had seen so much happiness. Why
      had it to be swept away? In the streets of the city she noted for the
      first time the architecture of hurry and heard the language of hurry on
      the mouths of its inhabitants&mdash;clipped words, formless sentences,
      potted expressions of approval or disgust. Month by month things were
      stepping livelier, but to what goal? The population still rose, but what
      was the quality of the men born? The particular millionaire who owned the
      freehold of Wickham Place, and desired to erect Babylonian flats upon it&mdash;what
      right had he to stir so large a portion of the quivering jelly? He was not
      a fool&mdash;she had heard him expose Socialism&mdash;but true insight
      began just where his intelligence ended, and one gathered that this was
      the case with most millionaires. What right had such men&mdash;But
      Margaret checked herself. That way lies madness. Thank goodness, she, too,
      had some money, and could purchase a new home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tibby, now in his second year at Oxford, was down for the Easter vacation,
      and Margaret took the opportunity of having a serious talk with him. Did
      he at all know where he wanted to live? Tibby didn&rsquo;t know that he did
      know. Did he at all know what he wanted to do? He was equally uncertain,
      but when pressed remarked that he should prefer to be quite free of any
      profession. Margaret was not shocked, but went on sewing for a few minutes
      before she replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was thinking of Mr. Vyse. He never strikes me as particularly happy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye&mdash;es.&rdquo; said Tibby, and then held his mouth open in a curious
      quiver, as if he, too, had thought of Mr. Vyse, had seen round, through,
      over, and beyond Mr. Vyse, had weighed Mr. Vyse, grouped him, and finally
      dismissed him as having no possible bearing on the Subject under
      discussion. That bleat of Tibby&rsquo;s infuriated Helen. But Helen was now down
      in the dining room preparing a speech about political economy. At times
      her voice could be heard declaiming through the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Mr. Vyse is rather a wretched, weedy man, don&rsquo;t you think? Then
      there&rsquo;s Guy. That was a pitiful business. Besides&rdquo;&mdash;shifting to the
      general&mdash;&ldquo;every one is the better for some regular work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Groans.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall stick to it,&rdquo; she continued, smiling. &ldquo;I am not saying it to
      educate you; it is what I really think. I believe that in the last century
      men have developed the desire for work, and they must not starve it. It&rsquo;s
      a new desire. It goes with a great deal that&rsquo;s bad, but in itself it&rsquo;s
      good, and I hope that for women, too, &lsquo;not to work&rsquo; will soon become as
      shocking as &lsquo;not to be married&rsquo; was a hundred years ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no experience of this profound desire to which you allude,&rdquo;
       enunciated Tibby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll leave the subject till you do. I&rsquo;m not going to rattle you
      round. Take your time. Only do think over the lives of the men you like
      most, and see how they&rsquo;ve arranged them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like Guy and Mr. Vyse most,&rdquo; said Tibby faintly, and leant so far back
      in his chair that he extended in a horizontal line from knees to throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m not serious because I don&rsquo;t use the traditional
      arguments&mdash;making money, a sphere awaiting you, and so on&mdash;all
      of which are, for various reasons, cant.&rdquo; She sewed on. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m only your
      sister. I haven&rsquo;t any authority over you, and I don&rsquo;t want to have any.
      Just to put before you what I think the Truth. You see&rdquo;&mdash;she shook
      off the pince-nez to which she had recently taken&mdash;&ldquo;in a few years we
      shall be the same age practically, and I shall want you to help me. Men
      are so much nicer than women.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Labouring under such a delusion, why do you not marry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I sometimes jolly well think I would if I got the chance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has nobody arst you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only ninnies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do people ask Helen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Plentifully.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me about them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me about your ninnies, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They were men who had nothing better to do,&rdquo; said his sister, feeling
      that she was entitled to score this point. &ldquo;So take warning; you must
      work, or else you must pretend to work, which is what I do. Work, work,
      work if you&rsquo;d save your soul and your body. It is honestly a necessity,
      dear boy. Look at the Wilcoxes, look at Mr. Pembroke. With all their
      defects of temper and understanding, such men give me more pleasure than
      many who are better equipped, and I think it is because they have worked
      regularly and honestly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spare me the Wilcoxes,&rdquo; he moaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall not. They are the right sort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, goodness me, Meg&mdash;!&rdquo; he protested, suddenly sitting up, alert
      and angry. Tibby, for all his defects, had a genuine personality.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, they&rsquo;re as near the right sort as you can imagine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no&mdash;oh, no!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was thinking of the younger son, whom I once classed as a ninny, but
      who came back so ill from Nigeria. He&rsquo;s gone out there again, Evie Wilcox
      tells me&mdash;out to his duty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Duty&rdquo; always elicited a groan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t want the money, it is work he wants, though it is beastly work&mdash;dull
      country, dishonest natives, an eternal fidget over fresh water and food...
      A nation that can produce men of that sort may well be proud. No wonder
      England has become an Empire.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;EMPIRE!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t bother over results,&rdquo; said Margaret, a little sadly. &ldquo;They are
      too difficult for me. I can only look at the men. An Empire bores me, so
      far, but I can appreciate the heroism that builds it up. London bores me,
      but what thousands of splendid people are labouring to make London&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What it is,&rdquo; he sneered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What it is, worse luck. I want activity without civilisation. How
      paradoxical! Yet I expect that is what we shall find in heaven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I,&rdquo; said Tibby, &ldquo;want civilisation without activity, which, I expect,
      is what we shall find in the other place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t go as far as the other place, Tibbikins, if you want that.
      You can find it at Oxford.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stupid&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I&rsquo;m stupid, get me back to the house-hunting. I&rsquo;ll even live in Oxford
      if you like&mdash;North Oxford. I&rsquo;ll live anywhere except Bournemouth,
      Torquay, and Cheltenham. Oh yes, or Ilfracombe and Swanage and Tunbridge
      Wells and Surbiton and Bedford. There on no account.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;London, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I agree, but Helen rather wants to get away from London. However, there&rsquo;s
      no reason we shouldn&rsquo;t have a house in the country and also a flat in
      town, provided we all stick together and contribute. Though of course&mdash;Oh,
      how one does maunder on and to think, to think of the people who are
      really poor. How do they live? Not to move about the world would kill me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she spoke, the door was flung open, and Helen burst in in a state of
      extreme excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my dears, what do you think? You&rsquo;ll never guess. A woman&rsquo;s been here
      asking me for her husband. Her WHAT?&rdquo; (Helen was fond of supplying her own
      surprise.) &ldquo;Yes, for her husband, and it really is so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not anything to do with Bracknell?&rdquo; cried Margaret, who had lately taken
      on an unemployed of that name to clean the knives and boots.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I offered Bracknell, and he was rejected. So was Tibby. (Cheer up,
      Tibby!) It&rsquo;s no one we know. I said, &lsquo;Hunt, my good woman; have a good
      look round, hunt under the tables, poke up the chimney, shake out the
      antimacassars. Husband? husband?&rsquo; Oh, and she so magnificently dressed and
      tinkling like a chandelier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Helen, what did really happen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I say. I was, as it were, orating my speech. Annie opens the door
      like a fool, and shows a female straight in on me, with my mouth open.
      Then we began&mdash;very civilly. &lsquo;I want my husband, what I have reason
      to believe is here.&rsquo; No&mdash;how unjust one is. She said &lsquo;whom,&rsquo; not
      &lsquo;what.&rsquo; She got it perfectly. So I said, &lsquo;Name, please?&rsquo; and she said,
      &lsquo;Lan, Miss,&rsquo; and there we were.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lan or Len. We were not nice about our vowels. Lanoline.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what an extraordinary&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said, &lsquo;My good Mrs. Lanoline, we have some grave misunderstanding here.
      Beautiful as I am, my modesty is even more remarkable than my beauty, and
      never, never has Mr. Lanoline rested his eyes on mine.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you were pleased,&rdquo; said Tibby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Helen squeaked. &ldquo;A perfectly delightful experience. Oh, Mrs.
      Lanoline&rsquo;s a dear&mdash;she asked for a husband as if he were an umbrella.
      She mislaid him Saturday afternoon&mdash;and for a long time suffered no
      inconvenience. But all night, and all this morning her apprehensions grew.
      Breakfast didn&rsquo;t seem the same&mdash;no, no more did lunch, and so she
      strolled up to 2 Wickham Place as being the most likely place for the
      missing article.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how on earth&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t begin how on earthing. &lsquo;I know what I know,&rsquo; she kept repeating,
      not uncivilly, but with extreme gloom. In vain I asked her what she did
      know. Some knew what others knew, and others didn&rsquo;t, and then others again
      had better be careful. Oh dear, she was incompetent! She had a face like a
      silkworm, and the dining-room reeks of orris-root. We chatted pleasantly a
      little about husbands, and I wondered where hers was too, and advised her
      to go to the police. She thanked me. We agreed that Mr. Lanoline&rsquo;s a
      notty, notty man, and hasn&rsquo;t no business to go on the lardy-da. But I
      think she suspected me up to the last. Bags I writing to Aunt Juley about
      this. Now, Meg, remember&mdash;bags I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bag it by all means,&rdquo; murmured Margaret, putting down her work. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not
      sure that this is so funny, Helen. It means some horrible volcano smoking
      somewhere, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so&mdash;she doesn&rsquo;t really mind. The admirable creature
      isn&rsquo;t capable of tragedy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her husband may be, though,&rdquo; said Margaret, moving to the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no, not likely. No one capable of tragedy could have married Mrs.
      Lanoline.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was she pretty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her figure may have been good once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The flats, their only outlook, hung like an ornate curtain between
      Margaret and the welter of London. Her thoughts turned sadly to
      house-hunting. Wickham Place had been so safe. She feared, fantastically,
      that her own little flock might be moving into turmoil and squalor, into
      nearer contact with such episodes as these.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tibby and I have again been wondering where we&rsquo;ll live next September,&rdquo;
       she said at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tibby had better first wonder what he&rsquo;ll do,&rdquo; retorted Helen; and that
      topic was resumed, but with acrimony. Then tea came, and after tea Helen
      went on preparing her speech, and Margaret prepared one, too, for they
      were going out to a discussion society on the morrow. But her thoughts
      were poisoned. Mrs. Lanoline had risen out of the abyss, like a faint
      smell, a goblin football, telling of a life where love and hatred had both
      decayed.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV
    </h2>
    <p>
      The mystery, like so many mysteries, was explained. Next day, just as they
      were dressed to go out to dinner, a Mr. Bast called. He was a clerk in the
      employment of the Porphyrion Fire Insurance Company. Thus much from his
      card. He had come &ldquo;about the lady yesterday.&rdquo; Thus much from Annie, who
      had shown him into the dining-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cheers, children!&rdquo; cried Helen. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Mrs. Lanoline.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tibby was interested. The three hurried downstairs, to find, not the gay
      dog they expected, but a young man, colourless, toneless, who had already
      the mournful eyes above a drooping moustache that are so common in London,
      and that haunt some streets of the city like accusing presences. One
      guessed him as the third generation, grandson to the shepherd or ploughboy
      whom civilisation had sucked into the town; as one of the thousands who
      have lost the life of the body and failed to reach the life of the spirit.
      Hints of robustness survived in him, more than a hint of primitive good
      looks, and Margaret, noting the spine that might have been straight, and
      the chest that might have broadened, wondered whether it paid to give up
      the glory of the animal for a tail coat and a couple of ideas. Culture had
      worked in her own case, but during the last few weeks she had doubted
      whether it humanised the majority, so wide and so widening is the gulf
      that stretches between the natural and the philosophic man, so many the
      good chaps who are wrecked in trying to cross it. She knew this type very
      well&mdash;the vague aspirations, the mental dishonesty, the familiarity
      with the outsides of books. She knew the very tones in which he would
      address her. She was only unprepared for an example of her own
      visiting-card.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t remember giving me this, Miss Schlegel?&rdquo; said he, uneasily
      familiar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I can&rsquo;t say I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that was how it happened, you see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did we meet, Mr. Bast? For the minute I don&rsquo;t remember.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a concert at the Queen&rsquo;s Hall. I think you will recollect,&rdquo; he
      added pretentiously, &ldquo;when I tell you that it included a performance of
      the Fifth Symphony of Beethoven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We hear the Fifth practically every time it&rsquo;s done, so I&rsquo;m not sure&mdash;do
      you remember, Helen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was it the time the sandy cat walked round the balustrade?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He thought not.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I don&rsquo;t remember. That&rsquo;s the only Beethoven I ever remember
      specially.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you, if I may say so, took away my umbrella, inadvertently of
      course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Likely enough,&rdquo; Helen laughed, &ldquo;for I steal umbrellas even oftener than I
      hear Beethoven. Did you get it back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, thank you, Miss Schlegel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The mistake arose out of my card, did it?&rdquo; interposed Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, the mistake arose&mdash;it was a mistake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The lady who called here yesterday thought that you were calling too, and
      that she could find you?&rdquo; she continued, pushing him forward, for, though
      he had promised an explanation, he seemed unable to give one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s so, calling too&mdash;a mistake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why&mdash;?&rdquo; began Helen, but Margaret laid a hand on her arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said to my wife,&rdquo; he continued more rapidly &ldquo;I said to Mrs. Bast, &lsquo;I
      have to pay a call on some friends,&rsquo; and Mrs. Bast said to me, &lsquo;Do go.&rsquo; 
      While I was gone, however, she wanted me on important business, and
      thought I had come here, owing to the card, and so came after me, and I
      beg to tender my apologies, and hers as well, for any inconvenience we may
      have inadvertently caused you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No inconvenience,&rdquo; said Helen; &ldquo;but I still don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An air of evasion characterised Mr. Bast. He explained again, but was
      obviously lying, and Helen didn&rsquo;t see why he should get off. She had the
      cruelty of youth. Neglecting her sister&rsquo;s pressure, she said, &ldquo;I still
      don&rsquo;t understand. When did you say you paid this call?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call? What call?&rdquo; said he, staring as if her question had been a foolish
      one, a favourite device of those in mid-stream.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This afternoon call.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the afternoon, of course!&rdquo; he replied, and looked at Tibby to see how
      the repartee went. But Tibby was unsympathetic, and said, &ldquo;Saturday
      afternoon or Sunday afternoon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;S&mdash;Saturday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really!&rdquo; said Helen; &ldquo;and you were still calling on Sunday, when your
      wife came here. A long visit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t call that fair,&rdquo; said Mr. Bast, going scarlet and handsome. There
      was fight in his eyes. &ldquo;I know what you mean, and it isn&rsquo;t so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t let us mind,&rdquo; said Margaret, distressed again by odours from
      the abyss.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was something else,&rdquo; he asserted, his elaborate manner breaking down.
      &ldquo;I was somewhere else to what you think, so there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was good of you to come and explain,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The rest is naturally
      no concern of ours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but I want&mdash;I wanted&mdash;have you ever read The Ordeal of
      Richard Feverel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a beautiful book. I wanted to get back to the earth, don&rsquo;t you see,
      like Richard does in the end. Or have you ever read Stevenson&rsquo;s Prince
      Otto?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen and Tibby groaned gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s another beautiful book. You get back to the earth in that. I
      wanted&mdash;&rdquo; He mouthed affectedly. Then through the mists of his
      culture came a hard fact, hard as a pebble. &ldquo;I walked all the Saturday
      night,&rdquo; said Leonard. &ldquo;I walked.&rdquo; A thrill of approval ran through the
      sisters. But culture closed in again. He asked whether they had ever read
      E. V. Lucas&rsquo;s Open Road.
    </p>
    <p>
      Said Helen, &ldquo;No doubt it&rsquo;s another beautiful book, but I&rsquo;d rather hear
      about your road.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I walked.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How far?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, nor for how long. It got too dark to see my watch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were you walking alone, may I ask?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, straightening himself; &ldquo;but we&rsquo;d been talking it over at
      the office. There&rsquo;s been a lot of talk at the office lately about these
      things. The fellows there said one steers by the Pole Star, and I looked
      it up in the celestial atlas, but once out of doors everything gets so
      mixed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk to me about the Pole Star,&rdquo; interrupted Helen, who was
      becoming interested. &ldquo;I know its little ways. It goes round and round, and
      you go round after it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I lost it entirely. First of all the street lamps, then the trees,
      and towards morning it got cloudy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tibby, who preferred his comedy undiluted, slipped from the room. He knew
      that this fellow would never attain to poetry, and did not want to hear
      him trying.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret and Helen remained. Their brother influenced them more than they
      knew; in his absence they were stirred to enthusiasm more easily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did you start from?&rdquo; cried Margaret. &ldquo;Do tell us more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I took the Underground to Wimbledon. As I came out of the office I said
      to myself, &lsquo;I must have a walk once in a way. If I don&rsquo;t take this walk
      now, I shall never take it.&rsquo; I had a bit of dinner at Wimbledon, and then&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But not good country there, is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was gas-lamps for hours. Still, I had all the night, and being out was
      the great thing. I did get into woods, too, presently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, go on,&rdquo; said Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve no idea how difficult uneven ground is when it&rsquo;s dark.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you actually go off the roads?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes. I always meant to go off the roads, but the worst of it is that
      it&rsquo;s more difficult to find one&rsquo;s way.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Bast, you&rsquo;re a born adventurer,&rdquo; laughed Margaret. &ldquo;No professional
      athlete would have attempted what you&rsquo;ve done. It&rsquo;s a wonder your walk
      didn&rsquo;t end in a broken neck. Whatever did your wife say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Professional athletes never move without lanterns and compasses,&rdquo; said
      Helen. &ldquo;Besides, they can&rsquo;t walk. It tires them. Go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I felt like R. L. S. You probably remember how in Virginibus.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but the wood. This &lsquo;ere wood. How did you get out of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I managed one wood, and found a road the other side which went a good bit
      uphill. I rather fancy it was those North Downs, for the road went off
      into grass, and I got into another wood. That was awful, with gorse
      bushes. I did wish I&rsquo;d never come, but suddenly it got light&mdash;just
      while I seemed going under one tree. Then I found a road down to a
      station, and took the first train I could back to London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But was the dawn wonderful?&rdquo; asked Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      With unforgettable sincerity he replied, &ldquo;No.&rdquo; The word flew again like a
      pebble from the sling. Down toppled all that had seemed ignoble or
      literary in his talk, down toppled tiresome R. L. S. and the &ldquo;love of the
      earth&rdquo; and his silk top-hat. In the presence of these women Leonard had
      arrived, and he spoke with a flow, an exultation, that he had seldom
      known.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The dawn was only grey, it was nothing to mention.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just a grey evening turned upside down. I know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;and I was too tired to lift up my head to look at it, and so cold
      too. I&rsquo;m glad I did it, and yet at the time it bored me more than I can
      say. And besides&mdash;you can believe me or not as you choose&mdash;I was
      very hungry. That dinner at Wimbledon&mdash;I meant it to last me all
      night like other dinners. I never thought that walking would make such a
      difference. Why, when you&rsquo;re walking you want, as it were, a breakfast and
      luncheon and tea during the night as well, and I&rsquo;d nothing but a packet of
      Woodbines. Lord, I did feel bad! Looking back, it wasn&rsquo;t what you may call
      enjoyment. It was more a case of sticking to it. I did stick. I&mdash;I
      was determined. Oh, hang it all! what&rsquo;s the good&mdash;I mean, the good of
      living in a room for ever? There one goes on day after day, same old game,
      same up and down to town, until you forget there is any other game. You
      ought to see once in a way what&rsquo;s going on outside, if it&rsquo;s only nothing
      particular after all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should just think you ought,&rdquo; said Helen, sitting on the edge of
      the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sound of a lady&rsquo;s voice recalled him from sincerity, and he said:
      &ldquo;Curious it should all come about from reading something of Richard
      Jefferies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me, Mr. Bast, but you&rsquo;re wrong there. It didn&rsquo;t. It came from
      something far greater.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But she could not stop him. Borrow was imminent after Jefferies&mdash;Borrow,
      Thoreau, and sorrow. R. L. S. brought up the rear, and the outburst ended
      in a swamp of books. No disrespect to these great names. The fault is ours, not
      theirs. They mean us to use them for sign-posts, and are not to blame if, in our 
      weakness, we mistake the sign-post for the destination. And Leonard had
      reached the destination. He had visited the county of Surrey when darkness
      covered its amenities, and  its cosy villas had re-entered ancient night.
      Every twelve hours this miracle happens, but he had troubled to go and see
      for himself. Within his cramped little mind dwelt something that was greater
      than Jefferies&rsquo; books&mdash;the  spirit that led Jefferies to write them;
      and his dawn, though revealing nothing but monotones, was part of the
      eternal sunrise that shows George Borrow Stonehenge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you don&rsquo;t think I was foolish?&rdquo; he asked becoming again the naive
      and sweet-tempered boy for whom Nature intended him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heavens, no!&rdquo; replied Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven help us if we do!&rdquo; replied Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very glad you say that. Now, my wife would never understand&mdash;not
      if I explained for days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it wasn&rsquo;t foolish!&rdquo; cried Helen, her eyes aflame. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve pushed back
      the boundaries; I think it splendid of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve not been content to dream as we have&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Though we have walked, too&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must show you a picture upstairs&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here the door-bell rang. The hansom had come to take them to their evening
      party.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, bother, not to say dash&mdash;I had forgotten we were dining out; but
      do, do, come round again and have a talk.&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, you must&mdash;do,&rdquo;
       echoed Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard, with extreme sentiment, replied: &ldquo;No, I shall not. It&rsquo;s better
      like this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why better?&rdquo; asked Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it is better not to risk a second interview. I shall always look back
      on this talk with you as one of the finest things in my life. Really. I
      mean this. We can never repeat. It has done me real good, and there we had
      better leave it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s rather a sad view of life, surely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Things so often get spoiled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; flashed Helen, &ldquo;but people don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He could not understand this. He continued in a vein which mingled true
      imagination and false. What he said wasn&rsquo;t wrong, but it wasn&rsquo;t right, and
      a false note jarred. One little twist, they felt, and the instrument might
      be in tune. One little strain, and it might be silent for ever. He thanked
      the ladies very much, but he would not call again. There was a moment&rsquo;s
      awkwardness, and then Helen said: &ldquo;Go, then; perhaps you know best; but
      never forget you&rsquo;re better than Jefferies.&rdquo; And he went. Their hansom
      caught him up at the corner, passed with a waving of hands, and vanished
      with its accomplished load into the evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      London was beginning to illuminate herself against the night. Electric
      lights sizzled and jagged in the main thoroughfares, gas-lamps in the side
      streets glimmered a canary gold or green. The sky was a crimson
      battlefield of spring, but London was not afraid. Her smoke mitigated the
      splendour, and the clouds down Oxford Street were a delicately painted
      ceiling, which adorned while it did not distract. She had never known the
      clear-cut armies of the purer air. Leonard hurried through her tinted
      wonders, very much part of the picture. His was a grey life, and to
      brighten it he had ruled off few a corners for romance. The Miss Schlegels&mdash;or,
      to speak more accurately, his interview with them&mdash;were to fill such
      a corner, nor was it by any means the first time that he had talked
      intimately to strangers. The habit was analogous to a debauch, an outlet,
      though the worst of outlets, for instincts that would not be denied.
      Terrifying him, it would beat down his suspicions and prudence until he
      was confiding secrets to people whom he had scarcely seen. It brought him
      many fears and some pleasant memories. Perhaps the keenest happiness he
      had ever known was during a railway journey to Cambridge, where a
      decent-mannered undergraduate had spoken to him. They had got into
      conversation, and gradually Leonard flung reticence aside, told some of
      his domestic troubles and hinted at the rest. The undergraduate, supposing
      they could start a friendship, asked him to &ldquo;coffee after hall,&rdquo; which he
      accepted, but afterwards grew shy, and took care not to stir from the
      commercial hotel where he lodged. He did not want Romance to collide with
      the Porphyrion, still less with Jacky, and people with fuller, happier
      lives are slow to understand this. To the Schlegels, as to the
      undergraduate, he was an interesting creature, of whom they wanted to see
      more. But they to him were denizens of Romance, who must keep to the
      corner he had assigned them, pictures that must not walk out of their
      frames.
    </p>
    <p>
      His behaviour over Margaret&rsquo;s visiting-card had been typical. His had
      scarcely been a tragic marriage. Where there is no money and no
      inclination to violence tragedy cannot be generated. He could not leave
      his wife, and he did not want to hit her. Petulance and squalor were
      enough. Here &ldquo;that card&rdquo; had come in. Leonard, though furtive, was untidy,
      and left it lying about. Jacky found it, and then began, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that
      card, eh?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, don&rsquo;t you wish you knew what that card was?&rdquo; &ldquo;Len, who&rsquo;s
      Miss Schlegel?&rdquo; etc. Months passed, and the card, now as a joke, now as a
      grievance, was handed about, getting dirtier and dirtier. It followed them
      when they moved from Camelia Road to Tulse Hill. It was submitted to third
      parties. A few inches of pasteboard, it became the battlefield on which
      the souls of Leonard and his wife contended. Why did he not say, &ldquo;A lady
      took my umbrella, another gave me this that I might call for my umbrella&rdquo;?
      Because Jacky would have disbelieved him? Partly, but chiefly because he
      was sentimental. No affection gathered round the card, but it symbolised
      the life of culture, that Jacky should never spoil. At night he would say
      to himself, &ldquo;Well, at all events, she doesn&rsquo;t know about that card. Yah!
      done her there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Poor Jacky! she was not a bad sort, and had a great deal to bear. She drew
      her own conclusion&mdash;she was only capable of drawing one conclusion&mdash;and
      in the fulness of time she acted upon it. All the Friday Leonard had
      refused to speak to her, and had spent the evening observing the stars. On
      the Saturday he went up, as usual, to town, but he came not back Saturday
      night, nor Sunday morning, nor Sunday afternoon. The inconvenience grew
      intolerable, and though she was now of a retiring habit, and shy of women,
      she went up to Wickham Place. Leonard returned in her absence. The card,
      the fatal card, was gone from the pages of Ruskin, and he guessed what had
      happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he had exclaimed, greeting her with peals of laughter. &ldquo;I know
      where you&rsquo;ve been, but you don&rsquo;t know where I&rsquo;ve been.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jacky sighed, said, &ldquo;Len, I do think you might explain,&rdquo; and resumed
      domesticity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Explanations were difficult at this stage, and Leonard was too silly&mdash;or
      it is tempting to write, too sound a chap to attempt them. His reticence
      was not entirely the shoddy article that a business life promotes, the
      reticence that pretends that nothing is something, and hides behind the
      Daily Telegraph. The adventurer, also, is reticent, and it is an adventure
      for a clerk to walk for a few hours in darkness. You may laugh at him, you
      who have slept nights out on the veldt, with your rifle beside you and all
      the atmosphere of adventure pat. And you also may laugh who think
      adventures silly. But do not be surprised if Leonard is shy whenever he
      meets you, and if the Schlegels rather than Jacky hear about the dawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      That the Schlegels had not thought him foolish became a permanent joy. He
      was at his best when he thought of them. It buoyed him as he journeyed
      home beneath fading heavens. Somehow the barriers of wealth had fallen,
      and there had been&mdash;he could not phrase it&mdash;a general assertion
      of the wonder of the world. &ldquo;My conviction,&rdquo; says the mystic, &ldquo;gains
      infinitely the moment another soul will believe in it,&rdquo; and they had
      agreed that there was something beyond life&rsquo;s daily grey. He took off his
      top-hat and smoothed it thoughtfully. He had hitherto supposed the unknown
      to be books, literature, clever conversation, culture. One raised oneself
      by study, and got upsides with the world. But in that quick interchange a
      new light dawned. Was that &ldquo;something&rdquo; walking in the dark among the
      suburban hills?
    </p>
    <p>
      He discovered that he was going bareheaded down Regent Street. London came
      back with a rush. Few were about at this hour, but all whom he passed
      looked at him with a hostility that was the more impressive because it was
      unconscious. He put his hat on. It was too big; his head disappeared like
      a pudding into a basin, the ears bending outwards at the touch of the
      curly brim. He wore it a little backwards, and its effect was greatly to
      elongate the face and to bring out the distance between the eyes and the
      moustache. Thus equipped, he escaped criticism. No one felt uneasy as he
      titupped along the pavements, the heart of a man ticking fast in his
      chest.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV
    </h2>
    <p>
      The sisters went out to dinner full of their adventure, and when they were
      both full of the same subject, there were few dinner-parties that could
      stand up against them. This particular one, which was all ladies, had more
      kick in it than most, but succumbed after a struggle. Helen at one part of
      the table, Margaret at the other, would talk of Mr. Bast and of no one
      else, and somewhere about the entree their monologues collided, fell
      ruining, and became common property. Nor was this all. The dinner-party
      was really an informal discussion club; there was a paper after it, read
      amid coffee-cups and laughter in the drawing-room, but dealing more or
      less thoughtfully with some topic of general interest. After the paper
      came a debate, and in this debate Mr. Bast also figured, appearing now as
      a bright spot in civilisation, now as a dark spot, according to the
      temperament of the speaker. The subject of the paper had been, &ldquo;How ought
      I to dispose of my money?&rdquo; the reader professing to be a millionaire on
      the point of death, inclined to bequeath her fortune for the foundation of
      local art galleries, but open to conviction from other sources. The
      various parts had been assigned beforehand, and some of the speeches were
      amusing. The hostess assumed the ungrateful role of &ldquo;the millionaire&rsquo;s
      eldest son,&rdquo; and implored her expiring parent not to dislocate Society by
      allowing such vast sums to pass out of the family. Money was the fruit of
      self-denial, and the second generation had a right to profit by the
      self-denial of the first. What right had &ldquo;Mr. Bast&rdquo; to profit? The
      National Gallery was good enough for the likes of him. After property had
      had its say&mdash;a saying that is necessarily ungracious&mdash;the
      various philanthropists stepped forward. Something must be done for &ldquo;Mr.
      Bast&rdquo;; his conditions must be improved without impairing his independence;
      he must have a free library, or free tennis-courts; his rent must be paid
      in such a way that he did not know it was being paid; it must be made
      worth his while to join the Territorials; he must be forcibly parted from
      his uninspiring wife, the money going to her as compensation; he must be
      assigned a Twin Star, some member of the leisured classes who would watch
      over him ceaselessly (groans from Helen); he must be given food but no
      clothes, clothes but no food, a third-return ticket to Venice, without
      either food or clothes when he arrived there. In short, he might be given
      anything and everything so long as it was not the money itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      And here Margaret interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Order, order, Miss Schlegel!&rdquo; said the reader of the paper. &ldquo;You are
      here, I understand, to advise me in the interests of the Society for the
      Preservation of Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty. I cannot
      have you speaking out of your role. It makes my poor head go round, and I
      think you forget that I am very ill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your head won&rsquo;t go round if only you&rsquo;ll listen to my argument,&rdquo; said
      Margaret. &ldquo;Why not give him the money itself? You&rsquo;re supposed to have
      about thirty thousand a year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have I? I thought I had a million.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t a million your capital? Dear me! we ought to have settled that.
      Still, it doesn&rsquo;t matter. Whatever you&rsquo;ve got, I order you to give as many
      poor men as you can three hundred a year each.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that would be pauperising them,&rdquo; said an earnest girl, who liked the
      Schlegels, but thought them a little unspiritual at times.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not if you gave them so much. A big windfall would not pauperise a man.
      It is these little driblets, distributed among too many, that do the harm.
      Money&rsquo;s educational. It&rsquo;s far more educational than the things it buys.&rdquo;
       There was a protest. &ldquo;In a sense,&rdquo; added Margaret, but the protest
      continued. &ldquo;Well, isn&rsquo;t the most civilized thing going, the man who has
      learnt to wear his income properly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly what your Mr. Basts won&rsquo;t do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give them a chance. Give them money. Don&rsquo;t dole them out poetry-books and
      railway-tickets like babies. Give them the wherewithal to buy these
      things. When your Socialism comes it may be different, and we may think in
      terms of commodities instead of cash. Till it comes give people cash, for
      it is the warp of civilisation, whatever the woof may be. The imagination
      ought to play upon money and realise it vividly, for it&rsquo;s the&mdash;the
      second most important thing in the world. It is so slurred over and hushed
      up, there is so little clear thinking&mdash;oh, political economy, of
      course, but so few of us think clearly about our own private incomes, and
      admit that independent thoughts are in nine cases out of ten the result of
      independent means. Money: give Mr. Bast money, and don&rsquo;t bother about his
      ideals. He&rsquo;ll pick up those for himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She leant back while the more earnest members of the club began to
      misconstrue her. The female mind, though cruelly practical in daily life,
      cannot bear to hear ideals belittled in conversation, and Miss Schlegel
      was asked however she could say such dreadful things, and what it would
      profit Mr. Bast if he gained the whole world and lost his own soul. She
      answered, &ldquo;Nothing, but he would not gain his soul until he had gained a
      little of the world.&rdquo; Then they said, &ldquo;No, we do not believe it,&rdquo; and she
      admitted that an overworked clerk may save his soul in the
      superterrestrial sense, where the effort will be taken for the deed, but
      she denied that he will ever explore the spiritual resources of this
      world, will ever know the rarer joys of the body, or attain to clear and
      passionate intercourse with his fellows. Others had attacked the fabric of
      Society&mdash;Property, Interest, etc.; she only fixed her eyes on a few
      human beings, to see how, under present conditions, they could be made
      happier. Doing good to humanity was useless: the many-coloured efforts
      thereto spreading over the vast area like films and resulting in an
      universal grey. To do good to one, or, as in this case, to a few, was the
      utmost she dare hope for.
    </p>
    <p>
      Between the idealists, and the political economists, Margaret had a bad
      time. Disagreeing elsewhere, they agreed in disowning her, and in keeping
      the administration of the millionaire&rsquo;s money in their own hands. The
      earnest girl brought forward a scheme of &ldquo;personal supervision and mutual
      help,&rdquo; the effect of which was to alter poor people until they became
      exactly like people who were not so poor. The hostess pertinently remarked
      that she, as eldest son, might surely rank among the millionaire&rsquo;s
      legatees. Margaret weakly admitted the claim, and another claim was at
      once set up by Helen, who declared that she had been the millionaire&rsquo;s
      housemaid for over forty years, overfed and underpaid; was nothing to be
      done for her, so corpulent and poor? The millionaire then read out her
      last will and testament, in which she left the whole of her fortune to the
      Chancellor of the Exchequer. Then she died. The serious parts of the
      discussion had been of higher merit than the playful&mdash;in a men&rsquo;s
      debate is the reverse more general?&mdash;but the meeting broke up
      hilariously enough, and a dozen happy ladies dispersed to their homes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen and Margaret walked with the earnest girl as far as Battersea Bridge
      Station, arguing copiously all the way. When she had gone they were
      conscious of an alleviation, and of the great beauty of the evening. They
      turned back towards Oakley Street. The lamps and the plane-trees,
      following the line of the embankment, struck a note of dignity that is
      rare in English cities. The seats, almost deserted, were here and there
      occupied by gentlefolk in evening dress, who had strolled out from the
      houses behind to enjoy fresh air and the whisper of the rising tide. There
      is something continental about Chelsea Embankment. It is an open space
      used rightly, a blessing more frequent in Germany than here. As Margaret
      and Helen sat down, the city behind them seemed to be a vast theatre, an
      opera-house in which some endless trilogy was performing, and they
      themselves a pair of satisfied subscribers, who did not mind losing a
      little of the second act.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cold?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tired?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The earnest girl&rsquo;s train rumbled away over the bridge.
     </p>
    <p>      
      &ldquo;I say, Helen&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are we really going to follow up Mr. Bast?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think we won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no good, I think, unless you really mean to know people. The
      discussion brought that home to me. We got on well enough with him in a
      spirit of excitement, but think of rational intercourse. We mustn&rsquo;t play
      at friendship. No, it&rsquo;s no good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s Mrs. Lanoline, too,&rdquo; Helen yawned. &ldquo;So dull.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just so, and possibly worse than dull.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to know how he got hold of your card.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he said&mdash;something about a concert and an umbrella.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then did the card see the wife&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Helen, come to bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, just a little longer, it is so beautiful. Tell me; oh yes; did you
      say money is the warp of the world?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what&rsquo;s the woof?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very much what one chooses,&rdquo; said Margaret. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s something that isn&rsquo;t
      money&mdash;one can&rsquo;t say more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Walking at night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For Tibby, Oxford?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now that we have to leave Wickham Place, I begin to think it&rsquo;s that. For
      Mrs. Wilcox it was certainly Howards End.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One&rsquo;s own name will carry immense distances. Mr. Wilcox, who was sitting
      with friends many seats away, heard this, rose to his feet, and strolled
      along towards the speakers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is sad to suppose that places may ever be more important than people,&rdquo;
       continued Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Meg? They&rsquo;re so much nicer generally. I&rsquo;d rather think of that
      forester&rsquo;s house in Pomerania than of the fat Herr Forstmeister who lived
      in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe we shall come to care about people less and less, Helen. The
      more people one knows the easier it becomes to replace them. It&rsquo;s one of
      the curses of London. I quite expect to end my life caring most for a
      place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here Mr. Wilcox reached them. It was several weeks since they had met.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I thought I recognised your voices. Whatever
      are you both doing down here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His tones were protective. He implied that one ought not to sit out on
      Chelsea Embankment without a male escort. Helen resented this, but
      Margaret accepted it as part of the good man&rsquo;s equipment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What an age it is since I&rsquo;ve seen you, Mr. Wilcox. I met Evie in the
      Tube, though, lately. I hope you have good news of your son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Paul?&rdquo; said Mr. Wilcox, extinguishing his cigarette, and sitting down
      between them. &ldquo;Oh, Paul&rsquo;s all right. We had a line from Madeira. He&rsquo;ll be
      at work again by now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ugh&mdash;&rdquo; said Helen, shuddering from complex causes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t the climate of Nigeria too horrible?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some one&rsquo;s got to go,&rdquo; he said simply. &ldquo;England will never keep her trade
      overseas unless she is prepared to make sacrifices. Unless we get firm in
      West Africa, Ger&mdash;untold complications may follow. Now tell me all
      your news.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ve had a splendid evening,&rdquo; cried Helen, who always woke up at the
      advent of a visitor. &ldquo;We belong to a kind of club that reads papers,
      Margaret and I&mdash;all women, but there is a discussion after. This
      evening it was on how one ought to leave one&rsquo;s money&mdash;whether to
      one&rsquo;s family, or to the poor, and if so how&mdash;oh, most interesting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man of business smiled. Since his wife&rsquo;s death he had almost doubled
      his income. He was an important figure at last, a reassuring name on
      company prospectuses, and life had treated him very well. The world seemed
      in his grasp as he listened to the River Thames, which still flowed inland
      from the sea. So wonderful to the girls, it held no mysteries for him. He
      had helped to shorten its long tidal trough by taking shares in the lock
      at Teddington, and if he and other capitalists thought good, some day it
      could be shortened again. With a good dinner inside him and an amiable but
      academic woman on either flank, he felt that his hands were on all the
      ropes of life, and that what he did not know could not be worth knowing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sounds a most original entertainment!&rdquo; he exclaimed, and laughed in his
      pleasant way. &ldquo;I wish Evie would go to that sort of thing. But she hasn&rsquo;t
      the time. She&rsquo;s taken to breeding Aberdeen terriers&mdash;jolly little
      dogs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I expect we&rsquo;d better be doing the same, really.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We pretend we&rsquo;re improving ourselves, you see,&rdquo; said Helen a little
      sharply, for the Wilcox glamour is not of the kind that returns, and she
      had bitter memories of the days when a speech such as he had just made
      would have impressed her favourably. &ldquo;We suppose it a good thing to waste
      an evening once a fortnight over a debate, but, as my sister says, it may
      be better to breed dogs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all. I don&rsquo;t agree with your sister. There&rsquo;s nothing like a debate
      to teach one quickness. I often wish I had gone in for them when I was a
      youngster. It would have helped me no end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quickness&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Quickness in argument. Time after time I&rsquo;ve missed scoring a point
      because the other man has had the gift of the gab and I haven&rsquo;t. Oh, I
      believe in these discussions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The patronising tone, thought Margaret, came well enough from a man who
      was old enough to be their father. She had always maintained that Mr.
      Wilcox had a charm. In times of sorrow or emotion his inadequacy had
      pained her, but it was pleasant to listen to him now, and to watch his
      thick brown moustache and high forehead confronting the stars. But Helen
      was nettled. The aim of their debates she implied was Truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, it doesn&rsquo;t much matter what subject you take,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret laughed and said, &ldquo;But this is going to be far better than the
      debate itself.&rdquo; Helen recovered herself and laughed too. &ldquo;No, I won&rsquo;t go
      on,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just put our special case to Mr. Wilcox.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About Mr. Bast? Yes, do. He&rsquo;ll be more lenient to a special case.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Mr. Wilcox, do first light another cigarette. It&rsquo;s this. We&rsquo;ve just
      come across a young fellow, who&rsquo;s evidently very poor, and who seems
      interest&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s his profession?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clerk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you remember, Margaret?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Porphyrion Fire Insurance Company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes; the nice people who gave Aunt Juley a new hearth rug. He seems
      interesting, in some ways very, and one wishes one could help him. He is
      married to a wife whom he doesn&rsquo;t seem to care for much. He likes books,
      and what one may roughly call adventure, and if he had a chance&mdash;But
      he is so poor. He lives a life where all the money is apt to go on
      nonsense and clothes. One is so afraid that circumstances will be too
      strong for him and that he will sink. Well, he got mixed up in our debate.
      He wasn&rsquo;t the subject of it, but it seemed to bear on his point. Suppose a
      millionaire died, and desired to leave money to help such a man. How
      should he be helped? Should he be given three hundred pounds a year
      direct, which was Margaret&rsquo;s plan? Most of them thought this would
      pauperise him. Should he and those like him be given free libraries? I
      said &lsquo;No!&rsquo; He doesn&rsquo;t want more books to read, but to read books rightly.
      My suggestion was he should be given something every year towards a summer
      holiday, but then there is his wife, and they said she would have to go
      too. Nothing seemed quite right! Now what do you think? Imagine that you
      were a millionaire, and wanted to help the poor. What would you do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wilcox, whose fortune was not so very far below the standard
      indicated, laughed exuberantly. &ldquo;My dear Miss Schlegel, I will not rush in
      where your sex has been unable to tread. I will not add another plan to
      the numerous excellent ones that have been already suggested. My only
      contribution is this: let your young friend clear out of the Porphyrion
      Fire Insurance Company with all possible speed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; said Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lowered his voice. &ldquo;This is between friends. It&rsquo;ll be in the Receiver&rsquo;s
      hands before Christmas. It&rsquo;ll smash,&rdquo; he added, thinking that she had not
      understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me, Helen, listen to that. And he&rsquo;ll have to get another place!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;WILL have? Let him leave the ship before it sinks. Let him get one now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather than wait, to make sure?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Decidedly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again the Olympian laugh, and the lowered voice. &ldquo;Naturally the man who&rsquo;s
      in a situation when he applies stands a better chance, is in a stronger
      position, that the man who isn&rsquo;t. It looks as if he&rsquo;s worth something. I
      know by myself&mdash;(this is letting you into the State secrets)&mdash;it
      affects an employer greatly. Human nature, I&rsquo;m afraid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t thought of that,&rdquo; murmured Margaret, while Helen said, &ldquo;Our
      human nature appears to be the other way round. We employ people because
      they&rsquo;re unemployed. The boot man, for instance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how does he clean the boots?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not well,&rdquo; confessed Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There you are!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then do you really advise us to tell this youth&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I advise nothing,&rdquo; he interrupted, glancing up and down the Embankment,
      in case his indiscretion had been overheard. &ldquo;I oughtn&rsquo;t to have spoken&mdash;but
      I happen to know, being more or less behind the scenes. The Porphyrion&rsquo;s a
      bad, bad concern&mdash;Now, don&rsquo;t say I said so. It&rsquo;s outside the Tariff
      Ring.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly I won&rsquo;t say. In fact, I don&rsquo;t know what that means.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought an insurance company never smashed,&rdquo; was Helen&rsquo;s contribution.
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t the others always run in and save them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re thinking of reinsurance,&rdquo; said Mr. Wilcox mildly. &ldquo;It is exactly
      there that the Porphyrion is weak. It has tried to undercut, has been
      badly hit by a long series of small fires, and it hasn&rsquo;t been able to
      reinsure. I&rsquo;m afraid that public companies don&rsquo;t save one another for
      love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Human nature,&rsquo; I suppose,&rdquo; quoted Helen, and he laughed and agreed that
      it was. When Margaret said that she supposed that clerks, like every one
      else, found it extremely difficult to get situations in these days, he
      replied, &ldquo;Yes, extremely,&rdquo; and rose to rejoin his friends. He knew by his
      own office&mdash;seldom a vacant post, and hundreds of applicants for it;
      at present no vacant post.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how&rsquo;s Howards End looking?&rdquo; said Margaret, wishing to change the
      subject before they parted. Mr. Wilcox was a little apt to think one
      wanted to get something out of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s let.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really. And you wandering homeless in longhaired Chelsea? How strange are
      the ways of Fate!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; it&rsquo;s let unfurnished. We&rsquo;ve moved.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I thought of you both as anchored there for ever. Evie never told
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say when you met Evie the thing wasn&rsquo;t settled. We only moved a
      week ago. Paul has rather a feeling for the old place, and we held on for
      him to have his holiday there; but, really, it is impossibly small.
      Endless drawbacks. I forget whether you&rsquo;ve been up to it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As far as the house, never.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Howards End is one of those converted farms. They don&rsquo;t really do,
      spend what you will on them. We messed away with a garage all among the
      wych-elm roots, and last year we enclosed a bit of the meadow and
      attempted a rockery. Evie got rather keen on Alpine plants. But it didn&rsquo;t
      do&mdash;no, it didn&rsquo;t do. You remember, your sister will remember, the
      farm with those abominable guinea-fowls, and the hedge that the old woman
      never would cut properly, so that it all went thin at the bottom. And,
      inside the house, the beams&mdash;and the staircase through a door&mdash;picturesque
      enough, but not a place to live in.&rdquo; He glanced over the parapet
      cheerfully. &ldquo;Full tide. And the position wasn&rsquo;t right either. The
      neighbourhood&rsquo;s getting suburban. Either be in London or out of it, I say;
      so we&rsquo;ve taken a house in Ducie Street, close to Sloane Street, and a
      place right down in Shropshire&mdash;Oniton Grange. Ever heard of Oniton?
      Do come and see us&mdash;right away from everywhere, up towards Wales.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a change!&rdquo; said Margaret. But the change was in her own voice, which
      had become most sad. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine Howards End or Hilton without you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hilton isn&rsquo;t without us,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Charles is there still.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still?&rdquo; said Margaret, who had not kept up with the Charles&rsquo;s. &ldquo;But I
      thought he was still at Epsom. They were furnishing that Christmas&mdash;one
      Christmas. How everything alters! I used to admire Mrs. Charles from our
      windows very often. Wasn&rsquo;t it Epsom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but they moved eighteen months ago. Charles, the good chap&rdquo;&mdash;his
      voice dropped&mdash;&ldquo;thought I should be lonely. I didn&rsquo;t want him to
      move, but he would, and took a house at the other end of Hilton, down by
      the Six Hills. He had a motor, too. There they all are, a very jolly party&mdash;he
      and she and the two grandchildren.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I manage other people&rsquo;s affairs so much better than they manage them
      themselves,&rdquo; said Margaret as they shook hands. &ldquo;When you moved out of
      Howards End, I should have moved Mr. Charles Wilcox into it. I should have
      kept so remarkable a place in the family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it is,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t sold it, and don&rsquo;t mean to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; but none of you are there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ve got a splendid tenant&mdash;Hamar Bryce, an invalid. If Charles
      ever wanted it&mdash;but he won&rsquo;t. Dolly is so dependent on modern
      conveniences. No, we have all decided against Howards End. We like it in a
      way, but now we feel that it is neither one thing nor the other. One must
      have one thing or the other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And some people are lucky enough to have both. You&rsquo;re doing yourself
      proud, Mr. Wilcox. My congratulations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And mine,&rdquo; said Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do remind Evie to come and see us&mdash;2 Wickham Place. We shan&rsquo;t be
      there very long, either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You, too, on the move?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Next September,&rdquo; Margaret sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every one moving! Good-bye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tide had begun to ebb. Margaret leant over the parapet and watched it
      sadly. Mr. Wilcox had forgotten his wife, Helen her lover; she herself was
      probably forgetting. Every one moving. Is it worth while attempting the
      past when there is this continual flux even in the hearts of men?
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen roused her by saying: &ldquo;What a prosperous vulgarian Mr. Wilcox has
      grown! I have very little use for him in these days. However, he did tell
      us about the Porphyrion. Let us write to Mr. Bast as soon as ever we get
      home, and tell him to clear out of it at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do; yes, that&rsquo;s worth doing. Let us.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XVI
    </h2>
    <p>
      Leonard accepted the invitation to tea next Saturday. But he was right;
      the visit proved a conspicuous failure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sugar?&rdquo; said Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cake?&rdquo; said Helen. &ldquo;The big cake or the little deadlies? I&rsquo;m afraid you
      thought my letter rather odd, but we&rsquo;ll explain&mdash;we aren&rsquo;t odd,
      really&mdash;nor affected, really. We&rsquo;re over-expressive&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As a lady&rsquo;s lap-dog Leonard did not excel. He was not an Italian, still
      less a Frenchman, in whose blood there runs the very spirit of persiflage
      and of gracious repartee. His wit was the Cockney&rsquo;s; it opened no doors
      into imagination, and Helen was drawn up short by &ldquo;The more a lady has to
      say, the better,&rdquo; administered waggishly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ladies brighten&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know. The darlings are regular sunbeams. Let me give you a plate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you like your work?&rdquo; interposed Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      He, too, was drawn up short. He would not have these women prying into his
      work. They were Romance, and so was the room to which he had at last
      penetrated, with the queer sketches of people bathing upon its walls, and
      so were the very tea-cups, with their delicate borders of wild
      strawberries. But he would not let romance interfere with his life. There
      is the devil to pay then.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well enough,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your company is the Porphyrion, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s so.&rdquo;&mdash;becoming rather offended. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s funny how things
      get round.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why funny?&rdquo; asked Helen, who did not follow the workings of his mind. &ldquo;It
      was written as large as life on your card, and considering we wrote to you
      there, and that you replied on the stamped paper&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you call the Porphyrion one of the big Insurance Companies?&rdquo;
       pursued Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It depends on what you call big.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean by big, a solid, well-established concern, that offers a
      reasonably good career to its employes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t say&mdash;some would tell you one thing and others another,&rdquo;
       said the employee uneasily. &ldquo;For my own part&rdquo;&mdash;he shook his head&mdash;&ldquo;I
      only believe half I hear. Not that even; it&rsquo;s safer. Those clever ones
      come to the worse grief, I&rsquo;ve often noticed. Ah, you can&rsquo;t be too
      careful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He drank, and wiped his moustache, which was going to be one of those
      moustaches that always droop into tea-cups&mdash;more bother than they&rsquo;re
      worth, surely, and not fashionable either.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I quite agree, and that&rsquo;s why I was curious to know; is it a solid,
      well-established concern?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Leonard had no idea. He understood his own corner of the machine, but
      nothing beyond it. He desired to confess neither knowledge nor ignorance,
      and under these circumstances, another motion of the head seemed safest.
      To him, as to the British public, the Porphyrion was the Porphyrion of the
      advertisement&mdash;a giant, in the classical style, but draped
      sufficiently, who held in one hand a burning torch, and pointed with the
      other to St. Paul&rsquo;s and Windsor Castle. A large sum of money was inscribed
      below, and you drew your own conclusions. This giant caused Leonard to do
      arithmetic and write letters, to explain the regulations to new clients,
      and re-explain them to old ones. A giant was of an impulsive morality&mdash;one
      knew that much. He would pay for Mrs. Munt&rsquo;s hearthrug with ostentatious
      haste, a large claim he would repudiate quietly, and fight court by court.
      But his true fighting weight, his antecedents, his amours with other
      members of the commercial Pantheon&mdash;all these were as uncertain to
      ordinary mortals as were the escapades of Zeus. While the gods are
      powerful, we learn little about them. It is only in the days of their
      decadence that a strong light beats into heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were told the Porphyrion&rsquo;s no go,&rdquo; blurted Helen. &ldquo;We wanted to tell
      you; that&rsquo;s why we wrote.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A friend of ours did think that it is insufficiently reinsured,&rdquo; said
      Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Leonard had his clue.
    </p>
    <p>
      He must praise the Porphyrion. &ldquo;You can tell your friend,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that
      he&rsquo;s quite wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, good!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man coloured a little. In his circle to be wrong was fatal. The
      Miss Schlegels did not mind being wrong. They were genuinely glad that
      they had been misinformed. To them nothing was fatal but evil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wrong, so to speak,&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How &lsquo;so to speak&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean I wouldn&rsquo;t say he&rsquo;s right altogether.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But this was a blunder. &ldquo;Then he is right partly,&rdquo; said the elder woman,
      quick as lightning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard replied that every one was right partly, if it came to that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Bast, I don&rsquo;t understand business, and I dare say my questions are
      stupid, but can you tell me what makes a concern &lsquo;right&rsquo; or &lsquo;wrong&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Leonard sat back with a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our friend, who is also a business man, was so positive. He said before
      Christmas&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And advised you to clear out of it,&rdquo; concluded Helen. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t see
      why he should know better than you do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Leonard rubbed his hands. He was tempted to say that he knew nothing about
      the thing at all. But a commercial training was too strong for him. Nor
      could he say it was a bad thing, for this would be giving it away; nor yet
      that it was good, for this would be giving it away equally. He attempted
      to suggest that it was something between the two, with vast possibilities
      in either direction, but broke down under the gaze of four sincere eyes.
      And yet he scarcely distinguished between the two sisters. One was more
      beautiful and more lively, but &ldquo;the Miss Schlegels&rdquo; still remained a
      composite Indian god, whose waving arms and contradictory speeches were
      the product of a single mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One can but see,&rdquo; he remarked, adding, &ldquo;as Ibsen says, &lsquo;things happen.&rsquo;&rdquo;
       He was itching to talk about books and make the most of his romantic hour.
      Minute after minute slipped away, while the ladies, with imperfect skill,
      discussed the subject of reinsurance or praised their anonymous friend.
      Leonard grew annoyed&mdash;perhaps rightly. He made vague remarks about
      not being one of those who minded their affairs being talked over by
      others, but they did not take the hint. Men might have shown more tact.
      Women, however tactful elsewhere, are heavy-handed here. They cannot see
      why we should shroud our incomes and our prospects in a veil. &ldquo;How much
      exactly have you, and how much do you expect to have next June?&rdquo; And these
      were women with a theory, who held that reticence about money matters is
      absurd, and that life would be truer if each would state the exact size of
      the golden island upon which he stands, the exact stretch of warp over
      which he throws the woof that is not money. How can we do justice to the
      pattern otherwise?
    </p>
    <p>
      And the precious minutes slipped away, and Jacky and squalor came nearer.
      At last he could bear it no longer, and broke in, reciting the names of
      books feverishly. There was a moment of piercing joy when Margaret said,
      &ldquo;So YOU like Carlyle&rdquo; and then the door opened, and &ldquo;Mr. Wilcox, Miss
      Wilcox&rdquo; entered, preceded by two prancing puppies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the dears! Oh, Evie, how too impossibly sweet!&rdquo; screamed Helen,
      falling on her hands and knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We brought the little fellows round,&rdquo; said Mr. Wilcox.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I bred &rsquo;em myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, really! Mr. Bast, come and play with puppies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to be going now,&rdquo; said Leonard sourly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But play with puppies a little first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is Ahab, that&rsquo;s Jezebel,&rdquo; said Evie, who was one of those who name
      animals after the less successful characters of Old Testament history.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to be going.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen was too much occupied with puppies to notice him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Wilcox, Mr. Ba&mdash;Must you be really? Good-bye!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come again,&rdquo; said Helen from the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Leonard&rsquo;s gorge arose. Why should he come again? What was the good of
      it? He said roundly: &ldquo;No, I shan&rsquo;t; I knew it would be a failure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Most people would have let him go. &ldquo;A little mistake. We tried knowing
      another class&mdash;impossible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the Schlegels had never played with life. They had attempted
      friendship, and they would take the consequences. Helen retorted, &ldquo;I call
      that a very rude remark. What do you want to turn on me like that for?&rdquo;
       and suddenly the drawing-room re-echoed to a vulgar row.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ask me why I turn on you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want to have me here for?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To help you, you silly boy!&rdquo; cried Helen. &ldquo;And don&rsquo;t shout.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want your patronage. I don&rsquo;t want your tea. I was quite happy.
      What do you want to unsettle me for?&rdquo; He turned to Mr. Wilcox. &ldquo;I put it
      to this gentleman. I ask you, sir, am I to have my brain picked?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wilcox turned to Margaret with the air of humorous strength that he
      could so well command. &ldquo;Are we intruding, Miss Schlegel? Can we be of any
      use, or shall we go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Margaret ignored him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m connected with a leading insurance company, sir. I receive what I
      take to be an invitation from these&mdash;ladies&rdquo; (he drawled the word).
      &ldquo;I come, and it&rsquo;s to have my brain picked. I ask you, is it fair?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Highly unfair,&rdquo; said Mr. Wilcox, drawing a gasp from Evie, who knew that
      her father was becoming dangerous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, you hear that? Most unfair, the gentleman says. There! Not content
      with&rdquo;&mdash;pointing at Margaret&mdash;&ldquo;you can&rsquo;t deny it.&rdquo; His voice
      rose; he was falling into the rhythm of a scene with Jacky. &ldquo;But as soon
      as I&rsquo;m useful it&rsquo;s a very different thing. &lsquo;Oh yes, send for him.
      Cross-question him. Pick his brains.&rsquo; Oh yes. Now, take me on the whole,
      I&rsquo;m a quiet fellow: I&rsquo;m law-abiding, I don&rsquo;t wish any unpleasantness; but
      I&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You,&rdquo; said Margaret&mdash;&ldquo;you&mdash;you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laughter from Evie as at a repartee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are the man who tried to walk by the Pole Star.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      More laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You saw the sunrise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You tried to get away from the fogs that are stifling us all&mdash;away
      past books and houses to the truth. You were looking for a real home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fail to see the connection,&rdquo; said Leonard, hot with stupid anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So do I.&rdquo; There was a pause. &ldquo;You were that last Sunday&mdash;you are
      this to-day. Mr. Bast! I and my sister have talked you over. We wanted to
      help you; we also supposed you might help us. We did not have you here out
      of charity&mdash;which bores us&mdash;but because we hoped there would be
      a connection between last Sunday and other days. What is the good of your
      stars and trees, your sunrise and the wind, if they do not enter into our
      daily lives? They have never entered into mine, but into yours, we thought&mdash;Haven&rsquo;t
      we all to struggle against life&rsquo;s daily greyness, against pettiness,
      against mechanical cheerfulness, against suspicion? I struggle by
      remembering my friends; others I have known by remembering some place&mdash;some
      beloved place or tree&mdash;we thought you one of these.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, if there&rsquo;s been any misunderstanding,&rdquo; mumbled Leonard, &ldquo;all I
      can do is to go. But I beg to state&mdash;&rdquo; He paused. Ahab and Jezebel
      danced at his boots and made him look ridiculous. &ldquo;You were picking my
      brain for official information&mdash;I can prove it&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo; He
      blew his nose and left them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I help you now?&rdquo; said Mr. Wilcox, turning to Margaret. &ldquo;May I have
      one quiet word with him in the hall?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Helen, go after him&mdash;do anything&mdash;anything&mdash;to make the
      noodle understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But really&mdash;&rdquo; said their visitor. &ldquo;Ought she to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At once she went.
    </p>
    <p>
      He resumed. &ldquo;I would have chimed in, but I felt that you could polish him
      off for yourselves&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t interfere. You were splendid, Miss
      Schlegel&mdash;absolutely splendid. You can take my word for it, but there
      are very few women who could have managed him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; said Margaret distractedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bowling him over with those long sentences was what fetched me,&rdquo; cried
      Evie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, indeed,&rdquo; chuckled her father; &ldquo;all that part about &lsquo;mechanical
      cheerfulness&rsquo;&mdash;oh, fine!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very sorry,&rdquo; said Margaret, collecting herself. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a nice creature
      really. I cannot think what set him off. It has been most unpleasant for
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I didn&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo; Then he changed his mood. He asked if he might speak
      as an old friend, and, permission given, said: &ldquo;Oughtn&rsquo;t you really to be
      more careful?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret laughed, though her thoughts still strayed after Helen. &ldquo;Do you
      realise that it&rsquo;s all your fault?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re responsible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is the young man whom we were to warn against the Porphyrion. We
      warn him, and&mdash;look!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wilcox was annoyed. &ldquo;I hardly consider that a fair deduction,&rdquo; he
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Obviously unfair,&rdquo; said Margaret. &ldquo;I was only thinking how tangled things
      are. It&rsquo;s our fault mostly&mdash;neither yours nor his.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not his?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Schlegel, you are too kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, indeed,&rdquo; nodded Evie, a little contemptuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You behave much too well to people, and then they impose on you. I know
      the world and that type of man, and as soon as I entered the room I saw
      you had not been treating him properly. You must keep that type at a
      distance. Otherwise they forget themselves. Sad, but true. They aren&rsquo;t our
      sort, and one must face the fact.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye&mdash;es.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do admit that we should never have had the outburst if he was a
      gentleman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I admit it willingly,&rdquo; said Margaret, who was pacing up and down the
      room. &ldquo;A gentleman would have kept his suspicions to himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wilcox watched her with a vague uneasiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did he suspect you of?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of wanting to make money out of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Intolerable brute! But how were you to benefit?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly. How indeed! Just horrible, corroding suspicion. One touch of
      thought or of goodwill would have brushed it away. Just the senseless fear
      that does make men intolerable brutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I come back to my original point. You ought to be more careful, Miss
      Schlegel. Your servants ought to have orders not to let such people in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned to him frankly. &ldquo;Let me explain exactly why we like this man,
      and want to see him again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s your clever way of talking. I shall never believe you like him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do. Firstly, because he cares for physical adventure, just as you do.
      Yes, you go motoring and shooting; he would like to go camping out.
      Secondly, he cares for something special IN adventure. It is quickest to
      call that special something poetry&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s one of that writer sort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;oh no! I mean he may be, but it would be loathsome stuff. His
      brain is filled with the husks of books, culture&mdash;horrible; we want
      him to wash out his brain and go to the real thing. We want to show him
      how he may get upsides with life. As I said, either friends or the
      country, some&rdquo;&mdash;she hesitated&mdash;&ldquo;either some very dear person or
      some very dear place seems necessary to relieve life&rsquo;s daily grey, and to
      show that it is grey. If possible, one should have both.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Some of her words ran past Mr. Wilcox. He let them run past. Others he
      caught and criticised with admirable lucidity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your mistake is this, and it is a very common mistake. This young bounder
      has a life of his own. What right have you to conclude it is an
      unsuccessful life, or, as you call it, &lsquo;grey&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One minute. You know nothing about him. He probably has his own joys and
      interests&mdash;wife, children, snug little home. That&rsquo;s where we
      practical fellows&rdquo; he smiled&mdash;&ldquo;are more tolerant than you
      intellectuals. We live and let live, and assume that things are jogging on
      fairly well elsewhere, and that the ordinary plain man may be trusted to
      look after his own affairs. I quite grant&mdash;I look at the faces of the
      clerks in my own office, and observe them to be dull, but I don&rsquo;t know
      what&rsquo;s going on beneath. So, by the way, with London. I have heard you
      rail against London, Miss Schlegel, and it seems a funny thing to say but
      I was very angry with you. What do you know about London? You only see
      civilisation from the outside. I don&rsquo;t say in your case, but in too many
      cases that attitude leads to morbidity, discontent, and Socialism.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She admitted the strength of his position, though it undermined
      imagination. As he spoke, some outposts of poetry and perhaps of sympathy
      fell ruining, and she retreated to what she called her &ldquo;second line&rdquo;&mdash;to
      the special facts of the case.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His wife is an old bore,&rdquo; she said simply. &ldquo;He never came home last
      Saturday night because he wanted to be alone, and she thought he was with
      us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With YOU?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Evie tittered. &ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t got the cosy home that you assumed. He
      needs outside interests.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naughty young man!&rdquo; cried the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naughty?&rdquo; said Margaret, who hated naughtiness more than sin. &ldquo;When
      you&rsquo;re married Miss Wilcox, won&rsquo;t you want outside interests?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has apparently got them,&rdquo; put in Mr. Wilcox slyly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, indeed, father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was tramping in Surrey, if you mean that,&rdquo; said Margaret, pacing away
      rather crossly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I dare say!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Wilcox, he was!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M&mdash;m&mdash;m&mdash;m!&rdquo; from Mr. Wilcox, who thought the episode
      amusing, if risque. With most ladies he would not have discussed it, but
      he was trading on Margaret&rsquo;s reputation as an emancipated woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said so, and about such a thing he wouldn&rsquo;t lie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They both began to laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s where I differ from you. Men lie about their positions and
      prospects, but not about a thing of that sort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head. &ldquo;Miss Schlegel, excuse me, but I know the type.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said before&mdash;he isn&rsquo;t a type. He cares about adventures rightly.
      He&rsquo;s certain that our smug existence isn&rsquo;t all. He&rsquo;s vulgar and
      hysterical and bookish, but don&rsquo;t think that sums him up. There&rsquo;s manhood
      in him as well. Yes, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m trying to say. He&rsquo;s a real man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she spoke their eyes met, and it was as if Mr. Wilcox&rsquo;s defences fell.
      She saw back to the real man in him. Unwittingly she had touched his
      emotions.
    </p>
    <p>
      A woman and two men&mdash;they had formed the magic triangle of sex, and
      the male was thrilled to jealousy, in case the female was attracted by
      another male. Love, say the ascetics, reveals our shameful kinship with
      the beasts. Be it so: one can bear that; jealousy is the real shame. It is
      jealousy, not love, that connects us with the farmyard intolerably, and
      calls up visions of two angry cocks and a complacent hen. Margaret crushed
      complacency down because she was civilised. Mr. Wilcox, uncivilised,
      continued to feel anger long after he had rebuilt his defences, and was
      again presenting a bastion to the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Schlegel, you&rsquo;re a pair of dear creatures, but you really MUST be
      careful in this uncharitable world. What does your brother say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I forget.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely he has some opinion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He laughs, if I remember correctly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s very clever, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; said Evie, who had met and detested Tibby at
      Oxford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, pretty well&mdash;but I wonder what Helen&rsquo;s doing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is very young to undertake this sort of thing,&rdquo; said Mr. Wilcox.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret went out to the landing. She heard no sound, and Mr. Bast&rsquo;s
      topper was missing from the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Helen!&rdquo; she called.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; replied a voice from the library.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You in there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;he&rsquo;s gone some time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret went to her. &ldquo;Why, you&rsquo;re all alone,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;it&rsquo;s all right, Meg. Poor, poor creature&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come back to the Wilcoxes and tell me later&mdash;Mr. W much concerned,
      and slightly titillated.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ve no patience with him. I hate him. Poor dear Mr. Bast! he wanted
      to talk literature, and we would talk business. Such a muddle of a man,
      and yet so worth pulling through. I like him extraordinarily.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well done,&rdquo; said Margaret, kissing her, &ldquo;but come into the drawing-room
      now, and don&rsquo;t talk about him to the Wilcoxes. Make light of the whole
      thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen came and behaved with a cheerfulness that reassured their visitor&mdash;this
      hen at all events was fancy-free.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone with my blessing,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;and now for puppies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As they drove away, Mr. Wilcox said to his daughter:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am really concerned at the way those girls go on. They are as clever as
      you make &rsquo;em, but unpractical&mdash;God bless me! One of these days
      they&rsquo;ll go too far. Girls like that oughtn&rsquo;t to live alone in London.
      Until they marry, they ought to have some one to look after them. We must
      look in more often&mdash;we&rsquo;re better than no one. You like them, don&rsquo;t
      you, Evie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Evie replied: &ldquo;Helen&rsquo;s right enough, but I can&rsquo;t stand the toothy one. And
      I shouldn&rsquo;t have called either of them girls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Evie had grown up handsome. Dark-eyed, with the glow of youth under
      sunburn, built firmly and firm-lipped, she was the best the Wilcoxes could
      do in the way of feminine beauty. For the present, puppies and her father
      were the only things she loved, but the net of matrimony was being
      prepared for her, and a few days later she was attracted to a Mr. Percy
      Cahill, an uncle of Mrs. Charles&rsquo;s, and he was attracted to her.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVII
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Age of Property holds bitter moments even for a proprietor. When a
      move is imminent, furniture becomes ridiculous, and Margaret now lay awake
      at nights wondering where, where on earth they and all their belongings
      would be deposited in September next. Chairs, tables, pictures, books,
      that had rumbled down to them through the generations, must rumble forward
      again like a slide of rubbish to which she longed to give the final push,
      and send toppling into the sea. But there were all their father&rsquo;s books&mdash;they
      never read them, but they were their father&rsquo;s, and must be kept. There was
      the marble-topped chiffonier&mdash;their mother had set store by it, they
      could not remember why. Round every knob and cushion in the house gathered
      a sentiment that was at times personal, but more often a faint piety to
      the dead, a prolongation of rites that might have ended at the grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was absurd, if you came to think of it; Helen and Tibby came to think
      of it; Margaret was too busy with the house-agents. The feudal ownership
      of land did bring dignity, whereas the modern ownership of movables is
      reducing us again to a nomadic horde. We are reverting to the civilisation
      of luggage, and historians of the future will note how the middle classes
      accreted possessions without taking root in the earth, and may find in
      this the secret of their imaginative poverty. The Schlegels were certainly
      the poorer for the loss of Wickham Place. It had helped to balance their
      lives, and almost to counsel them. Nor is their ground-landlord
      spiritually the richer. He has built flats on its site, his motor-cars
      grow swifter, his exposures of Socialism more trenchant. But he has spilt
      the precious distillation of the years, and no chemistry of his can give
      it back to society again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret grew depressed; she was anxious to settle on a house before they
      left town to pay their annual visit to Mrs. Munt. She enjoyed this visit,
      and wanted to have her mind at ease for it. Swanage, though dull, was
      stable, and this year she longed more than usual for its fresh air and for
      the magnificent downs that guard it on the north. But London thwarted her;
      in its atmosphere she could not concentrate. London only stimulates, it
      cannot sustain; and Margaret, hurrying over its surface for a house
      without knowing what sort of a house she wanted, was paying for many a
      thrilling sensation in the past. She could not even break loose from
      culture, and her time was wasted by concerts which it would be a sin to
      miss, and invitations which it would never do to refuse. At last she grew
      desperate; she resolved that she would go nowhere and be at home to no one
      until she found a house, and broke the resolution in half an hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once she had humorously lamented that she had never been to Simpson&rsquo;s
      restaurant in the Strand. Now a note arrived from Miss Wilcox, asking her
      to lunch there. Mr Cahill was coming and the three would have such a jolly
      chat, and perhaps end up at the Hippodrome. Margaret had no strong regard
      for Evie, and no desire to meet her fiance, and she was surprised that
      Helen, who had been far funnier about Simpson&rsquo;s, had not been asked
      instead. But the invitation touched her by its intimate tone. She must
      know Evie Wilcox better than she supposed, and declaring that she &ldquo;simply
      must,&rdquo; she accepted.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when she saw Evie at the entrance of the restaurant, staring fiercely
      at nothing after the fashion of athletic women, her heart failed her anew.
      Miss Wilcox had changed perceptibly since her engagement. Her voice was
      gruffer, her manner more downright, and she was inclined to patronise the
      more foolish virgin. Margaret was silly enough to be pained at this.
      Depressed at her isolation, she saw not only houses and furniture, but the
      vessel of life itself slipping past her, with people like Evie and Mr.
      Cahill on board.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are moments when virtue and wisdom fail us, and one of them came to
      her at Simpson&rsquo;s in the Strand. As she trod the staircase, narrow, but
      carpeted thickly, as she entered the eating-room, where saddles of mutton
      were being trundled up to expectant clergymen, she had a strong, if
      erroneous, conviction of her own futility, and wished she had never come
      out of her backwater, where nothing happened except art and literature,
      and where no one ever got married or succeeded in remaining engaged. Then
      came a little surprise. &ldquo;Father might be of the party&mdash;yes, father
      was.&rdquo; With a smile of pleasure she moved forward to greet him, and her
      feeling of loneliness vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought I&rsquo;d get round if I could,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Evie told me of her little
      plan, so I just slipped in and secured a table. Always secure a table
      first. Evie, don&rsquo;t pretend you want to sit by your old father, because you
      don&rsquo;t. Miss Schlegel, come in my side, out of pity. My goodness, but you
      look tired! Been worrying round after your young clerks?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, after houses,&rdquo; said Margaret, edging past him into the box. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
      hungry, not tired; I want to eat heaps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s good. What&rsquo;ll you have?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fish pie,&rdquo; said she, with a glance at the menu.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fish pie! Fancy coming for fish pie to Simpson&rsquo;s. It&rsquo;s not a bit the
      thing to go for here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go for something for me, then,&rdquo; said Margaret, pulling off her gloves.
      Her spirits were rising, and his reference to Leonard Bast had warmed her
      curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Saddle of mutton,&rdquo; said he after profound reflection; &ldquo;and cider to
      drink. That&rsquo;s the type of thing. I like this place, for a joke, once in a
      way. It is so thoroughly Old English. Don&rsquo;t you agree?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Margaret, who didn&rsquo;t. The order was given, the joint rolled
      up, and the carver, under Mr. Wilcox&rsquo;s direction, cut the meat where it
      was succulent, and piled their plates high. Mr. Cahill insisted on
      sirloin, but admitted that he had made a mistake later on. He and Evie
      soon fell into a conversation of the &ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t; yes, you did&rdquo; type&mdash;conversation
      which, though fascinating to those who are engaged in it, neither desires
      nor deserves the attention of others.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a golden rule to tip the carver. Tip everywhere&rsquo;s my motto.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps it does make life more human.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then the fellows know one again. Especially in the East, if you tip, they
      remember you from year&rsquo;s end to year&rsquo;s end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you been in the East?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Greece and the Levant. I used to go out for sport and business to
      Cyprus; some military society of a sort there. A few piastres, properly
      distributed, help to keep one&rsquo;s memory green. But you, of course, think
      this shockingly cynical. How&rsquo;s your discussion society getting on? Any new
      Utopias lately?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m house-hunting, Mr. Wilcox, as I&rsquo;ve already told you once. Do you
      know of any houses?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Afraid I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s the point of being practical if you can&rsquo;t find two
      distressed females a house? We merely want a small house with large rooms,
      and plenty of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Evie, I like that! Miss Schlegel expects me to turn house-agent for her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that, father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want a new home in September, and some one must find it. I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Percy, do you know of anything?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say I do,&rdquo; said Mr. Cahill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How like you! You&rsquo;re never any good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never any good. Just listen to her! Never any good. Oh, come!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you aren&rsquo;t. Miss Schlegel, is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The torrent of their love, having splashed these drops at Margaret, swept
      away on its habitual course. She sympathised with it now, for a little
      comfort had restored her geniality. Speech and silence pleased her
      equally, and while Mr. Wilcox made some preliminary inquiries about
      cheese, her eyes surveyed the restaurant, and aired its well-calculated
      tributes to the solidity of our past. Though no more Old English than the
      works of Kipling, it had selected its reminiscences so adroitly that her
      criticism was lulled, and the guests whom it was nourishing for imperial
      purposes bore the outer semblance of Parson Adams or Tom Jones. Scraps of
      their talk jarred oddly on the ear. &ldquo;Right you are! I&rsquo;ll cable out to
      Uganda this evening,&rdquo; came from the table behind. &ldquo;Their Emperor wants
      war; well, let him have it,&rdquo; was the opinion of a clergyman. She smiled at
      such incongruities. &ldquo;Next time,&rdquo; she said to Mr. Wilcox, &ldquo;you shall come
      to lunch with me at Mr. Eustace Miles&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With pleasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you&rsquo;d hate it,&rdquo; she said, pushing her glass towards him for some more
      cider. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all proteids and body buildings, and people come up to you
      and beg your pardon, but you have such a beautiful aura.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never heard of an aura? Oh, happy, happy man! I scrub at mine for hours.
      Nor of an astral plane?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had heard of astral planes, and censured them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just so. Luckily it was Helen&rsquo;s aura, not mine, and she had to chaperone
      it and do the politenesses. I just sat with my handkerchief in my mouth
      till the man went.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Funny experiences seem to come to you two girls. No one&rsquo;s ever asked me
      about my&mdash;what d&rsquo;ye call it? Perhaps I&rsquo;ve not got one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re bound to have one, but it may be such a terrible colour that no
      one dares mention it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me, though, Miss Schlegel, do you really believe in the supernatural
      and all that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too difficult a question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&rsquo;s that? Gruyere or Stilton?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gruyere, please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better have Stilton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stilton. Because, though I don&rsquo;t believe in auras, and think Theosophy&rsquo;s
      only a halfway-house&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;Yet there may be something in it all the same,&rdquo; he concluded, with
      a frown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not even that. It may be halfway in the wrong direction. I can&rsquo;t explain.
      I don&rsquo;t believe in all these fads, and yet I don&rsquo;t like saying that I
      don&rsquo;t believe in them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He seemed unsatisfied, and said: &ldquo;So you wouldn&rsquo;t give me your word that
      you DON&rsquo;T hold with astral bodies and all the rest of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could,&rdquo; said Margaret, surprised that the point was of any importance
      to him. &ldquo;Indeed, I will. When I talked about scrubbing my aura, I was only
      trying to be funny. But why do you want this settled?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Mr. Wilcox, you do know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I am,&rdquo; &ldquo;No, you&rsquo;re not,&rdquo; burst from the lovers opposite. Margaret
      was silent for a moment, and then changed the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How&rsquo;s your house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Much the same as when you honoured it last week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean Ducie Street. Howards End, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why &lsquo;of course&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you turn out your tenant and let it to us? We&rsquo;re nearly demented.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me think. I wish I could help you. But I thought you wanted to be in
      town. One bit of advice: fix your district, then fix your price, and then
      don&rsquo;t budge. That&rsquo;s how I got both Ducie Street and Oniton. I said to
      myself, &lsquo;I mean to be exactly here,&rsquo; and I was, and Oniton&rsquo;s a place in a
      thousand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I do budge. Gentlemen seem to mesmerise houses&mdash;cow them with an
      eye, and up they come, trembling. Ladies can&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s the houses that are
      mesmerising me. I&rsquo;ve no control over the saucy things. Houses are alive.
      No?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m out of my depth,&rdquo; he said, and added: &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you talk rather like
      that to your office boy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did I?&mdash;I mean I did, more or less. I talk the same way to every one&mdash;or
      try to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know. And how much of it do you suppose he understood?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s his lookout. I don&rsquo;t believe in suiting my conversation to my
      company. One can doubtless hit upon some medium of exchange that seems to
      do well enough, but it&rsquo;s no more like the real thing than money is like
      food. There&rsquo;s no nourishment in it. You pass it to the lower classes, and
      they pass it back to you, and this you call &lsquo;social intercourse&rsquo; or
      &lsquo;mutual endeavour,&rsquo; when it&rsquo;s mutual priggishness if it&rsquo;s anything. Our
      friends at Chelsea don&rsquo;t see this. They say one ought to be at all costs
      intelligible, and sacrifice&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lower classes,&rdquo; interrupted Mr. Wilcox, as it were thrusting his hand
      into her speech. &ldquo;Well, you do admit that there are rich and poor. That&rsquo;s
      something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret could not reply. Was he incredibly stupid, or did he understand
      her better than she understood herself?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do admit that, if wealth was divided up equally, in a few years there
      would be rich and poor again just the same. The hard-working man would
      come to the top, the wastrel sink to the bottom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every one admits that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Socialists don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My Socialists do. Yours mayn&rsquo;t; but I strongly suspect yours of being not
      Socialists, but ninepins, which you have constructed for your own
      amusement. I can&rsquo;t imagine any living creature who would bowl over quite
      so easily.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He would have resented this had she not been a woman. But women may say
      anything&mdash;it was one of his holiest beliefs&mdash;and he only
      retorted, with a gay smile: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care. You&rsquo;ve made two damaging
      admissions, and I&rsquo;m heartily with you in both.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In time they finished lunch, and Margaret, who had excused herself from
      the Hippodrome, took her leave. Evie had scarcely addressed her, and she
      suspected that the entertainment had been planned by the father. He and
      she were advancing out of their respective families towards a more
      intimate acquaintance. It had begun long ago. She had been his wife&rsquo;s
      friend and, as such, he had given her that silver vinaigrette as a
      memento. It was pretty of him to have given that vinaigrette, and he had
      always preferred her to Helen&mdash;unlike most men. But the advance had
      been astonishing lately. They had done more in a week than in two years,
      and were really beginning to know each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not forget his promise to sample Eustace Miles, and asked him as
      soon as she could secure Tibby as his chaperon. He came, and partook of
      body-building dishes with humility.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning the Schlegels left for Swanage. They had not succeeded in
      finding a new home.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      As they were seated at Aunt Juley&rsquo;s breakfast-table at The Bays, parrying
      her excessive hospitality and enjoying the view of the bay, a letter came
      for Margaret and threw her into perturbation. It was from Mr. Wilcox. It
      announced an &ldquo;important change&rdquo; in his plans. Owing to Evie&rsquo;s marriage, he
      had decided to give up his house in Ducie Street, and was willing to let
      it on a yearly tenancy. It was a businesslike letter, and stated frankly
      what he would do for them and what he would not do. Also the rent. If they
      approved, Margaret was to come up AT ONCE&mdash;the words were underlined,
      as is necessary when dealing with women&mdash;and to go over the house
      with him. If they disapproved, a wire would oblige, as he should put it
      into the hands of an agent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The letter perturbed, because she was not sure what it meant. If he liked
      her, if he had manoeuvred to get her to Simpson&rsquo;s, might this be a
      manoeuvre to get her to London, and result in an offer of marriage? She
      put it to herself as indelicately as possible, in the hope that her brain
      would cry, &ldquo;Rubbish, you&rsquo;re a self-conscious fool!&rdquo; But her brain only
      tingled a little and was silent, and for a time she sat gazing at the
      mincing waves, and wondering whether the news would seem strange to the
      others.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as she began speaking, the sound of her own voice reassured her.
      There could be nothing in it. The replies also were typical, and in the
      burr of conversation her fears vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t go though&mdash;&rdquo; began her hostess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I needn&rsquo;t, but hadn&rsquo;t I better? It&rsquo;s really getting rather serious. We
      let chance after chance slip, and the end of it is we shall be bundled out
      bag and baggage into the street. We don&rsquo;t know what we WANT, that&rsquo;s the
      mischief with us&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, we have no real ties,&rdquo; said Helen, helping herself to toast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shan&rsquo;t I go up to town to-day, take the house if it&rsquo;s the least possible,
      and then come down by the afternoon train to-morrow, and start enjoying
      myself. I shall be no fun to myself or to others until this business is
      off my mind.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you won&rsquo;t do anything rash, Margaret?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing rash to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who ARE the Wilcoxes?&rdquo; said Tibby, a question that sounds silly, but was
      really extremely subtle as his aunt found to her cost when she tried to
      answer it. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t MANAGE the Wilcoxes; I don&rsquo;t see where they come IN.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No more do I,&rdquo; agreed Helen. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s funny that we just don&rsquo;t lose sight of
      them. Out of all our hotel acquaintances, Mr. Wilcox is the only one who
      has stuck. It is now over three years, and we have drifted away from far
      more interesting people in that time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Interesting people don&rsquo;t get one houses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meg, if you start in your honest-English vein, I shall throw the treacle
      at you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a better vein than the cosmopolitan,&rdquo; said Margaret, getting up.
      &ldquo;Now, children, which is it to be? You know the Ducie Street house. Shall
      I say yes or shall I say no? Tibby love&mdash;which? I&rsquo;m specially anxious
      to pin you both.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It all depends on what meaning you attach to the word &lsquo;possible&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It depends on nothing of the sort. Say &lsquo;yes.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say &lsquo;no.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Margaret spoke rather seriously. &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that our race
      is degenerating. We cannot settle even this little thing; what will it be
      like when we have to settle a big one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be as easy as eating,&rdquo; returned Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was thinking of father. How could he settle to leave Germany as he did,
      when he had fought for it as a young man, and all his feelings and friends
      were Prussian? How could he break loose with Patriotism and begin aiming
      at something else? It would have killed me. When he was nearly forty he
      could change countries and ideals&mdash;and we, at our age, can&rsquo;t change
      houses. It&rsquo;s humiliating.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your father may have been able to change countries,&rdquo; said Mrs. Munt with
      asperity, &ldquo;and that may or may not be a good thing. But he could change
      houses no better than you can, in fact, much worse. Never shall I forget
      what poor Emily suffered in the move from Manchester.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew it,&rdquo; cried Helen. &ldquo;I told you so. It is the little things one
      bungles at. The big, real ones are nothing when they come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bungle, my dear! You are too little to recollect&mdash;in fact, you
      weren&rsquo;t there. But the furniture was actually in the vans and on the move
      before the lease for Wickham Place was signed, and Emily took train with
      baby&mdash;who was Margaret then&mdash;and the smaller luggage for London,
      without so much as knowing where her new home would be. Getting away from
      that house may be hard, but it is nothing to the misery that we all went
      through getting you into it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen, with her mouth full, cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that&rsquo;s the man who beat the Austrians, and the Danes, and the French,
      and who beat the Germans that were inside himself. And we&rsquo;re like him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak for yourself,&rdquo; said Tibby. &ldquo;Remember that I am cosmopolitan,
      please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Helen may be right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course she&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; said Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen might be right, but she did not go up to London. Margaret did that.
      An interrupted holiday is the worst of the minor worries, and one may be
      pardoned for feeling morbid when a business letter snatches one away from
      the sea and friends. She could not believe that her father had ever felt
      the same. Her eyes had been troubling her lately, so that she could not
      read in the train and it bored her to look at the landscape, which she had
      seen but yesterday. At Southampton she &ldquo;waved&rdquo; to Frieda; Frieda was on
      her way down to join them at Swanage, and Mrs. Munt had calculated that
      their trains would cross. But Frieda was looking the other way, and
      Margaret travelled on to town feeling solitary and old-maidish. How like
      an old maid to fancy that Mr. Wilcox was courting her! She had once
      visited a spinster&mdash;poor, silly, and unattractive&mdash;whose mania
      it was that every man who approached her fell in love. How Margaret&rsquo;s
      heart had bled for the deluded thing! How she had lectured, reasoned, and
      in despair acquiesced! &ldquo;I may have been deceived by the curate, my dear,
      but the young fellow who brings the midday post really is fond of me, and
      has, as a matter of fact&mdash;&rdquo; It had always seemed to her the most
      hideous corner of old age, yet she might be driven into it herself by the
      mere pressure of virginity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wilcox met her at Waterloo himself. She felt certain that he was not
      the same as usual; for one thing, he took offence at everything she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is awfully kind of you,&rdquo; she began, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s not going
      to do. The house has not been built that suits the Schlegel family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! Have you come up determined not to deal?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not exactly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not exactly? In that case let&rsquo;s be starting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She lingered to admire the motor, which was new, and a fairer creature
      than the vermilion giant that had borne Aunt Juley to her doom three years
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Presumably it&rsquo;s very beautiful,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;How do you like it, Crane?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, let&rsquo;s be starting,&rdquo; repeated her host. &ldquo;How on earth did you know
      that my chauffeur was called Crane?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I know Crane; I&rsquo;ve been for a drive with Evie once. I know that
      you&rsquo;ve got a parlourmaid called Milton. I know all sorts of things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Evie!&rdquo; he echoed in injured tones. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t see her. She&rsquo;s gone out
      with Cahill. It&rsquo;s no fun, I can tell you, being left so much alone. I&rsquo;ve
      got my work all day&mdash;indeed, a great deal too much of it&mdash;but
      when I come home in the evening, I tell you, I can&rsquo;t stand the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In my absurd way, I&rsquo;m lonely too,&rdquo; Margaret replied. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s heart-breaking
      to leave one&rsquo;s old home. I scarcely remember anything before Wickham
      Place, and Helen and Tibby were born there. Helen says&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You, too, feel lonely?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Horribly. Hullo, Parliament&rsquo;s back!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wilcox glanced at Parliament contemptuously. The more important ropes
      of life lay elsewhere. &ldquo;Yes, they are talking again,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;But you
      were going to say&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only some rubbish about furniture. Helen says it alone endures while men
      and houses perish, and that in the end the world will be a desert of
      chairs and sofas&mdash;just imagine it!&mdash;rolling through infinity
      with no one to sit upon them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your sister always likes her little joke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She says &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; my brother says `No,&rsquo; to Ducie Street. It&rsquo;s no fun
      helping us, Mr. Wilcox, I assure you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not as unpractical as you pretend. I shall never believe it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret laughed. But she was&mdash;quite as unpractical. She could not
      concentrate on details. Parliament, the Thames, the irresponsive
      chauffeur, would flash into the field of house-hunting, and all demand
      some comment or response. It is impossible to see modern life steadily and
      see it whole, and she had chosen to see it whole. Mr. Wilcox saw steadily.
      He never bothered over the mysterious or the private. The Thames might run
      inland from the sea, the chauffeur might conceal all passion and
      philosophy beneath his unhealthy skin. They knew their own business, and
      he knew his.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet she liked being with him. He was not a rebuke, but a stimulus, and
      banished morbidity. Some twenty years her senior, he preserved a gift that
      she supposed herself to have already lost&mdash;not youth&rsquo;s creative
      power, but its self-confidence and optimism. He was so sure that it was a
      very pleasant world. His complexion was robust, his hair had receded but
      not thinned, the thick moustache and the eyes that Helen had compared to
      brandy-balls had an agreeable menace in them, whether they were turned
      towards the slums or towards the stars. Some day&mdash;in the millennium&mdash;there
      may be no need for his type. At present, homage is due to it from those
      who think themselves superior, and who possibly are.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At all events you responded to my telegram promptly,&rdquo; he remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, even I know a good thing when I see it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you don&rsquo;t despise the goods of this world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heavens, no! Only idiots and prigs do that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad, very glad,&rdquo; he repeated, suddenly softening and turning to
      her, as if the remark had pleased him. &ldquo;There is so much cant talked in
      would-be intellectual circles. I am glad you don&rsquo;t share it. Self-denial
      is all very well as a means of strengthening the character. But I can&rsquo;t
      stand those people who run down comforts. They have usually some axe to
      grind. Can you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Comforts are of two kinds,&rdquo; said Margaret, who was keeping herself in
      hand&mdash;&ldquo;those we can share with others, like fire, weather, or music;
      and those we can&rsquo;t&mdash;food, food, for instance. It depends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean reasonable comforts, of course. I shouldn&rsquo;t like to think that you&mdash;&rdquo;
       He bent nearer; the sentence died unfinished. Margaret&rsquo;s head turned very
      stupid, and the inside of it seemed to revolve like the beacon in a
      lighthouse. He did not kiss her, for the hour was half-past twelve, and
      the car was passing by the stables of Buckingham Palace. But the
      atmosphere was so charged with emotion that people only seemed to exist on
      her account, and she was surprised that Crane did not realise this, and
      turn round. Idiot though she might be, surely Mr. Wilcox was more&mdash;how
      should one put it?&mdash;more psychological than usual. Always a good
      judge of character for business purposes, he seemed this afternoon to
      enlarge his field, and to note qualities outside neatness, obedience, and
      decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to go over the whole house,&rdquo; she announced when they arrived. &ldquo;As
      soon as I get back to Swanage, which will be to-morrow afternoon, I&rsquo;ll
      talk it over once more with Helen and Tibby, and wire you &lsquo;yes&rsquo; or &lsquo;no.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right. The dining-room.&rdquo; And they began their survey.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dining-room was big, but over-furnished. Chelsea would have moaned
      aloud. Mr. Wilcox had eschewed those decorative schemes that wince, and
      relent, and refrain, and achieve beauty by sacrificing comfort and pluck.
      After so much self-colour and self-denial, Margaret viewed with relief the
      sumptuous dado, the frieze, the gilded wall-paper, amid whose foliage
      parrots sang. It would never do with her own furniture, but those heavy
      chairs, that immense sideboard loaded with presentation plate, stood up
      against its pressure like men. The room suggested men, and Margaret, keen
      to derive the modern capitalist from the warriors and hunters of the past,
      saw it as an ancient guest-hall, where the lord sat at meat among his
      thanes. Even the Bible&mdash;the Dutch Bible that Charles had brought back
      from the Boer War&mdash;fell into position. Such a room admitted loot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now the entrance-hall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The entrance-hall was paved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here we fellows smoke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We fellows smoked in chairs of maroon leather. It was as if a motor-car
      had spawned. &ldquo;Oh, jolly!&rdquo; said Margaret, sinking into one of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do like it?&rdquo; he said, fixing his eyes on her upturned face, and
      surely betraying an almost intimate note. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all rubbish not making
      oneself comfortable. Isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye&mdash;es. Semi-rubbish. Are those Cruikshanks?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gillrays. Shall we go on upstairs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does all this furniture come from Howards End?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Howards End furniture has all gone to Oniton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does&mdash;However, I&rsquo;m concerned with the house, not the furniture. How
      big is this smoking-room?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thirty by fifteen. No, wait a minute. Fifteen and a half.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, well. Mr. Wilcox, aren&rsquo;t you ever amused at the solemnity with which
      we middle classes approach the subject of houses?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They proceeded to the drawing-room. Chelsea managed better here. It was
      sallow and ineffective. One could visualise the ladies withdrawing to it,
      while their lords discussed life&rsquo;s realities below, to the accompaniment
      of cigars. Had Mrs. Wilcox&rsquo;s drawing-room at Howards End looked thus? Just
      as this thought entered Margaret&rsquo;s brain, Mr. Wilcox did ask her to be his
      wife, and the knowledge that she had been right so overcame her that she
      nearly fainted.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the proposal was not to rank among the world&rsquo;s great love scenes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Schlegel&rdquo;&mdash;his voice was firm&mdash;&ldquo;I have had you up on false
      pretences. I want to speak about a much more serious matter than a house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret almost answered: &ldquo;I know&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could you be induced to share my&mdash;is it probable&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Mr. Wilcox!&rdquo; she interrupted, taking hold of the piano and averting
      her eyes. &ldquo;I see, I see. I will write to you afterwards if I may.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He began to stammer. &ldquo;Miss Schlegel&mdash;Margaret you don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes! Indeed, yes!&rdquo; said Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am asking you to be my wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So deep already was her sympathy, that when he said, &ldquo;I am asking you to
      be my wife,&rdquo; she made herself give a little start. She must show surprise
      if he expected it. An immense joy came over her. It was indescribable. It
      had nothing to do with humanity, and most resembled the all-pervading
      happiness of fine weather. Fine weather is due to the sun, but Margaret
      could think of no central radiance here. She stood in his drawing-room
      happy, and longing to give happiness. On leaving him she realised that the
      central radiance had been love.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t offended, Miss Schlegel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How could I be offended?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment&rsquo;s pause. He was anxious to get rid of her, and she knew
      it. She had too much intuition to look at him as he struggled for
      possessions that money cannot buy. He desired comradeship and affection,
      but he feared them, and she, who had taught herself only to desire, and
      could have clothed the struggle with beauty, held back, and hesitated with
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; she continued. &ldquo;You will have a letter from me&mdash;I am
      going back to Swanage to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, and it&rsquo;s you I thank.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may order the motor round, mayn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would be most kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I had written. Ought I to have written?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s just one question&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head. He looked a little bewildered as they parted.
    </p>
    <p>
      They parted without shaking hands; she had kept the interview, for his
      sake, in tints of the quietest grey. She thrilled with happiness ere she
      reached her house. Others had loved her in the past, if one apply to their
      brief desires so grave a word, but the others had been &ldquo;ninnies&rdquo;&mdash;young
      men who had nothing to do, old men who could find nobody better. And she
      had often &lsquo;loved,&rsquo; too, but only so far as the facts of sex demanded: mere
      yearnings for the masculine sex to be dismissed for what they were worth,
      with a sigh. Never before had her personality been touched. She was not
      young or very rich, and it amazed her that a man of any standing should
      take her seriously. As she sat, trying to do accounts in her empty house,
      amidst beautiful pictures and noble books, waves of emotion broke, as if a
      tide of passion was flowing through the night air. She shook her head,
      tried to concentrate her attention, and failed. In vain did she repeat:
      &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve been through this sort of thing before.&rdquo; She had never been
      through it; the big machinery, as opposed to the little, had been set in
      motion, and the idea that Mr. Wilcox loved, obsessed her before she came
      to love him in return.
    </p>
    <p>
      She would come to no decision yet. &ldquo;Oh, sir, this is so sudden&rdquo;&mdash;that
      prudish phrase exactly expressed her when her time came. Premonitions are
      not preparation. She must examine more closely her own nature and his; she
      must talk it over judicially with Helen. It had been a strange love-scene&mdash;the
      central radiance unacknowledged from first to last. She, in his place,
      would have said Ich liebe dich, but perhaps it was not his habit to open
      the heart. He might have done it if she had pressed him&mdash;as a matter
      of duty, perhaps; England expects every man to open his heart once; but
      the effort would have jarred him, and never, if she could avoid it, should
      he lose those defences that he had chosen to raise against the world. He
      must never be bothered with emotional talk, or with a display of sympathy.
      He was an elderly man now, and it would be futile and impudent to correct
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Wilcox strayed in and out, ever a welcome ghost; surveying the scene,
      thought Margaret, without one hint of bitterness.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIX
    </h2>
    <p>
      If one wanted to show a foreigner England, perhaps the wisest course would
      be to take him to the final section of the Purbeck Hills, and stand him on
      their summit, a few miles to the east of Corfe. Then system after system
      of our island would roll together under his feet. Beneath him is the
      valley of the Frome, and all the wild lands that come tossing down from
      Dorchester, black and gold, to mirror their gorse in the expanses of
      Poole. The valley of the Stour is beyond, unaccountable stream, dirty at
      Blandford, pure at Wimborne&mdash;the Stour, sliding out of fat fields, to
      marry the Avon beneath the tower of Christ church. The valley of the Avon&mdash;invisible,
      but far to the north the trained eye may see Clearbury Ring that guards
      it, and the imagination may leap beyond that on to Salisbury Plain itself,
      and beyond the Plain to all the glorious downs of Central England. Nor is
      Suburbia absent. Bournemouth&rsquo;s ignoble coast cowers to the right,
      heralding the pine-trees that mean, for all their beauty, red houses, and
      the Stock Exchange, and extend to the gates of London itself. So
      tremendous is the City&rsquo;s trail! But the cliffs of Freshwater it shall
      never touch, and the island will guard the Island&rsquo;s purity till the end of
      time. Seen from the west the Wight is beautiful beyond all laws of beauty.
      It is as if a fragment of England floated forward to greet the foreigner&mdash;chalk
      of our chalk, turf of our turf, epitome of what will follow. And behind
      the fragment lies Southampton, hostess to the nations, and Portsmouth, a
      latent fire, and all around it, with double and treble collision of tides,
      swirls the sea. How many villages appear in this view! How many castles!
      How many churches, vanished or triumphant! How many ships, railways, and
      roads! What incredible variety of men working beneath that lucent sky to
      what final end! The reason fails, like a wave on the Swanage beach; the
      imagination swells, spreads, and deepens, until it becomes geographic and
      encircles England.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Frieda Mosebach, now Frau Architect Liesecke, and mother to her
      husband&rsquo;s baby, was brought up to these heights to be impressed, and,
      after a prolonged gaze, she said that the hills were more swelling here
      than in Pomerania, which was true, but did not seem to Mrs. Munt apposite.
      Poole Harbour was dry, which led her to praise the absence of muddy
      foreshore at Friedrich Wilhelms Bad, Rugen, where beech-trees hang over
      the tideless Baltic, and cows may contemplate the brine. Rather unhealthy
      Mrs. Munt thought this would be, water being safer when it moved about.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And your English lakes&mdash;Vindermere, Grasmere they, then, unhealthy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Frau Liesecke; but that is because they are fresh water, and
      different. Salt water ought to have tides, and go up and down a great
      deal, or else it smells. Look, for instance, at an aquarium.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An aquarium! Oh, MEESIS Munt, you mean to tell me that fresh aquariums
      stink less than salt? Why, then Victor, my brother-in-law, collected many
      tadpoles&mdash;&rdquo; &ldquo;You are not to say &lsquo;stink,&rsquo;&rdquo; interrupted Helen; &ldquo;at
      least, you may say it, but you must pretend you are being funny while you
      say it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then &lsquo;smell.&rsquo; And the mud of your Pool down there&mdash;does it not
      smell, or may I say &lsquo;stink,&rsquo; ha, ha?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There always has been mud in Poole Harbour,&rdquo; said Mrs. Munt, with a
      slight frown. &ldquo;The rivers bring it down, and a most valuable
      oyster-fishery depends upon it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that is so,&rdquo; conceded Frieda; and another international incident was
      closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Bournemouth is,&rsquo;&rdquo; resumed their hostess, quoting a local rhyme to which
      she was much attached&mdash;&ldquo;&lsquo;Bournemouth is, Poole was, and Swanage is to
      be the most important town of all and biggest of the three.&rsquo; Now, Frau
      Liesecke, I have shown you Bournemouth, and I have shown you Poole, so let
      us walk backward a little, and look down again at Swanage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aunt Juley, wouldn&rsquo;t that be Meg&rsquo;s train?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A tiny puff of smoke had been circling the harbour, and now was bearing
      southwards towards them over the black and the gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dearest Margaret, I do hope she won&rsquo;t be overtired.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I do wonder&mdash;I do wonder whether she&rsquo;s taken the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope she hasn&rsquo;t been hasty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So do I&mdash;oh, SO do I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will it be as beautiful as Wickham Place?&rdquo; Frieda asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think it would. Trust Mr. Wilcox for doing himself proud. All
      those Ducie Street houses are beautiful in their modern way, and I can&rsquo;t
      think why he doesn&rsquo;t keep on with it. But it&rsquo;s really for Evie that he
      went there, and now that Evie&rsquo;s going to be married&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve never seen Miss Wilcox, Frieda. How absurdly matrimonial you are!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But sister to that Paul?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And to that Charles,&rdquo; said Mrs. Munt with feeling. &ldquo;Oh, Helen, Helen,
      what a time that was!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen laughed. &ldquo;Meg and I haven&rsquo;t got such tender hearts. If there&rsquo;s a
      chance of a cheap house, we go for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now look, Frau Liesecke, at my niece&rsquo;s train. You see, it is coming
      towards us&mdash;coming, coming; and, when it gets to Corfe, it will
      actually go THROUGH the downs, on which we are standing, so that, if we
      walk over, as I suggested, and look down on Swanage, we shall see it
      coming on the other side. Shall we?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frieda assented, and in a few minutes they had crossed the ridge and
      exchanged the greater view for the lesser. Rather a dull valley lay below,
      backed by the slope of the coastward downs. They were looking across the
      Isle of Purbeck and on to Swanage, soon to be the most important town of
      all, and ugliest of the three. Margaret&rsquo;s train reappeared as promised,
      and was greeted with approval by her aunt. It came to a standstill in the
      middle distance, and there it had been planned that Tibby should meet her,
      and drive her, and a tea-basket, up to join them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; continued Helen to her cousin, &ldquo;the Wilcoxes collect houses as
      your Victor collects tadpoles. They have, one, Ducie Street; two, Howards
      End, where my great rumpus was; three, a country seat in Shropshire; four,
      Charles has a house in Hilton; and five, another near Epsom; and six, Evie
      will have a house when she marries, and probably a pied-a-terre in the
      country&mdash;which makes seven. Oh yes, and Paul a hut in Africa makes
      eight. I wish we could get Howards End. That was something like a dear
      little house! Didn&rsquo;t you think so, Aunt Juley?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had too much to do, dear, to look at it,&rdquo; said Mrs. Munt, with a
      gracious dignity. &ldquo;I had everything to settle and explain, and Charles
      Wilcox to keep in his place besides. It isn&rsquo;t likely I should remember
      much. I just remember having lunch in your bedroom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, so do I. But, oh dear, dear, how dreadful it all seems! And in the
      autumn there began that anti-Pauline movement&mdash;you, and Frieda, and
      Meg, and Mrs. Wilcox, all obsessed with the idea that I might yet marry
      Paul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You yet may,&rdquo; said Frieda despondently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen shook her head. &ldquo;The Great Wilcox Peril will never return. If I&rsquo;m
      certain of anything it&rsquo;s of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One is certain of nothing but the truth of one&rsquo;s own emotions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The remark fell damply on the conversation. But Helen slipped her arm
      round her cousin, somehow liking her the better for making it. It was not
      an original remark, nor had Frieda appropriated it passionately, for she
      had a patriotic rather than a philosophic mind. Yet it betrayed that
      interest in the universal which the average Teuton possesses and the
      average Englishman does not. It was, however illogically, the good, the
      beautiful, the true, as opposed to the respectable, the pretty, the
      adequate. It was a landscape of Bocklin&rsquo;s beside a landscape of Leader&rsquo;s,
      strident and ill-considered, but quivering into supernatural life. It
      sharpened idealism, stirred the soul. It may have been a bad preparation
      for what followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look!&rdquo; cried Aunt Juley, hurrying away from generalities over the narrow
      summit of the down. &ldquo;Stand where I stand, and you will see the pony-cart
      coming. I see the pony-cart coming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They stood and saw the pony-cart coming. Margaret and Tibby were presently
      seen coming in it. Leaving the outskirts of Swanage, it drove for a little
      through the budding lanes, and then began the ascent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you got the house?&rdquo; they shouted, long before she could possibly
      hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen ran down to meet her. The highroad passed over a saddle, and a track
      went thence at right angles alone the ridge of the down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you got the house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, what a nuisance! So we&rsquo;re as we were?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not exactly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She got out, looking tired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some mystery,&rdquo; said Tibby. &ldquo;We are to be enlightened presently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret came close up to her and whispered that she had had a proposal of
      marriage from Mr. Wilcox.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen was amused. She opened the gate on to the downs so that her brother
      might lead the pony through. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just like a widower,&rdquo; she remarked.
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve cheek enough for anything, and invariably select one of their
      first wife&rsquo;s friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret&rsquo;s face flashed despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That type&mdash;&rdquo; She broke off with a cry. &ldquo;Meg, not anything wrong with
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait one minute,&rdquo; said Margaret, whispering always.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you&rsquo;ve never conceivably&mdash;you&rsquo;ve never&mdash;&rdquo; She pulled
      herself together. &ldquo;Tibby, hurry up through; I can&rsquo;t hold this gate
      indefinitely. Aunt Juley! I say, Aunt Juley, make the tea, will you, and
      Frieda; we&rsquo;ve got to talk houses, and will come on afterwards.&rdquo; And then,
      turning her face to her sister&rsquo;s, she burst into tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret was stupefied. She heard herself saying, &ldquo;Oh, really&mdash;&rdquo; She
      felt herself touched with a hand that trembled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; sobbed Helen, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t, Meg, don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; She seemed incapable of
      saying any other word. Margaret, trembling herself, led her forward up the
      road, till they strayed through another gate on to the down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t do such a thing! I tell you not to&mdash;don&rsquo;t! I know&mdash;don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Panic and emptiness,&rdquo; sobbed Helen. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Margaret thought, &ldquo;Helen is a little selfish. I have never behaved
      like this when there has seemed a chance of her marrying.&rdquo; She said: &ldquo;But
      we would still see each other very&mdash;often, and you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a thing like that,&rdquo; sobbed Helen. And she broke right away and
      wandered distractedly upwards, stretching her hands towards the view and
      crying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s happened to you?&rdquo; called Margaret, following through the wind that
      gathers at sundown on the northern slopes of hills. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s stupid!&rdquo; And
      suddenly stupidity seized her, and the immense landscape was blurred. But
      Helen turned back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s happened to either of us,&rdquo; said Margaret, wiping her
      eyes. &ldquo;We must both have gone mad.&rdquo; Then Helen wiped hers, and they even
      laughed a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, sit down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right; I&rsquo;ll sit down if you&rsquo;ll sit down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There. (One kiss.) Now, whatever, whatever is the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do mean what I said. Don&rsquo;t; it wouldn&rsquo;t do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Helen, stop saying &lsquo;don&rsquo;t&rsquo;! It&rsquo;s ignorant. It&rsquo;s as if your head
      wasn&rsquo;t out of the slime. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t&rsquo; is probably what Mrs. Bast says all the
      day to Mr. Bast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me about it first, and meanwhile perhaps I&rsquo;ll have got my head out
      of the slime.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s better. Well, where shall I begin? When I arrived at Waterloo&mdash;no,
      I&rsquo;ll go back before that, because I&rsquo;m anxious you should know everything
      from the first. The &lsquo;first&rsquo; was about ten days ago. It was the day Mr.
      Bast came to tea and lost his temper. I was defending him, and Mr. Wilcox
      became jealous about me, however slightly. I thought it was the
      involuntary thing, which men can&rsquo;t help any more than we can. You know&mdash;at
      least, I know in my own case&mdash;when a man has said to me, &lsquo;So-and-so&rsquo;s
      a pretty girl,&rsquo; I am seized with a momentary sourness against So-and-so,
      and long to tweak her ear. It&rsquo;s a tiresome feeling, but not an important
      one, and one easily manages it. But it wasn&rsquo;t only this in Mr. Wilcox&rsquo;s
      case, I gather now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you love him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret considered. &ldquo;It is wonderful knowing that a real man cares for
      you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The mere fact of that grows more tremendous. Remember,
      I&rsquo;ve known and liked him steadily for nearly three years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But loved him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret peered into her past. It is pleasant to analyse feelings while
      they are still only feelings, and unembodied in the social fabric. With
      her arm round Helen, and her eyes shifting over the view, as if this
      country or that could reveal the secret of her own heart, she meditated
      honestly, and said, &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you will?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Margaret, &ldquo;of that I&rsquo;m pretty sure. Indeed, I began the moment
      he spoke to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And have settled to marry him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had, but am wanting a long talk about it now. What is it against him,
      Helen? You must try and say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen, in her turn, looked outwards. &ldquo;It is ever since Paul,&rdquo; she said
      finally.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what has Mr. Wilcox to do with Paul?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he was there, they were all there that morning when I came down to
      breakfast, and saw that Paul was frightened&mdash;the man who loved me
      frightened and all his paraphernalia fallen, so that I knew it was
      impossible, because personal relations are the important thing for ever
      and ever, and not this outer life of telegrams and anger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She poured the sentence forth in one breath, but her sister understood it,
      because it touched on thoughts that were familiar between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s foolish. In the first place, I disagree about the outer life.
      Well, we&rsquo;ve often argued that. The real point is that there is the widest
      gulf between my love-making and yours. Yours was romance; mine will be
      prose. I&rsquo;m not running it down&mdash;a very good kind of prose, but well
      considered, well thought out. For instance, I know all Mr. Wilcox&rsquo;s
      faults. He&rsquo;s afraid of emotion. He cares too much about success, too
      little about the past. His sympathy lacks poetry, and so isn&rsquo;t sympathy
      really. I&rsquo;d even say&rdquo;&mdash;she looked at the shining lagoons&mdash;&ldquo;that,
      spiritually, he&rsquo;s not as honest as I am. Doesn&rsquo;t that satisfy you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it doesn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Helen. &ldquo;It makes me feel worse and worse. You must
      be mad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret made a movement of irritation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t intend him, or any man or any woman, to be all my life&mdash;good
      heavens, no! There are heaps of things in me that he doesn&rsquo;t, and shall
      never, understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus she spoke before the wedding ceremony and the physical union, before
      the astonishing glass shade had fallen that interposes between married
      couples and the world. She was to keep her independence more than do most
      women as yet. Marriage was to alter her fortunes rather than her
      character, and she was not far wrong in boasting that she understood her
      future husband. Yet he did alter her character&mdash;a little. There was
      an unforeseen surprise, a cessation of the winds and odours of life, a
      social pressure that would have her think conjugally.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So with him,&rdquo; she continued. &ldquo;There are heaps of things in him&mdash;more
      especially things that he does that will always be hidden from me. He has
      all those public qualities which you so despise and which enable all this&mdash;&rdquo;
       She waved her hand at the landscape, which confirmed anything. &ldquo;If
      Wilcoxes hadn&rsquo;t worked and died in England for thousands of years, you and
      I couldn&rsquo;t sit here without having our throats cut. There would be no
      trains, no ships to carry us literary people about in, no fields even.
      Just savagery. No&mdash;perhaps not even that. Without their spirit life
      might never have moved out of protoplasm. More and more do I refuse to
      draw my income and sneer at those who guarantee it. There are times when
      it seems to me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And to me, and to all women. So one kissed Paul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s brutal,&rdquo; said Margaret. &ldquo;Mine is an absolutely different case.
      I&rsquo;ve thought things out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It makes no difference thinking things out. They come to the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rubbish!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a long silence, during which the tide returned into Poole
      Harbour. &ldquo;One would lose something,&rdquo; murmured Helen, apparently to
      herself. The water crept over the mud-flats towards the gorse and the
      blackened heather. Branksea Island lost its immense foreshores, and became
      a sombre episode of trees. Frome was forced inward towards Dorchester,
      Stour against Wimborne, Avon towards Salisbury, and over the immense
      displacement the sun presided, leading it to triumph ere he sank to rest.
      England was alive, throbbing through all her estuaries, crying for joy
      through the mouths of all her gulls, and the north wind, with contrary
      motion, blew stronger against her rising seas. What did it mean? For what
      end are her fair complexities, her changes of soil, her sinuous coast?
      Does she belong to those who have moulded her and made her feared by other
      lands, or to those who have added nothing to her power, but have somehow
      seen her, seen the whole island at once, lying as a jewel in a silver sea,
      sailing as a ship of souls, with all the brave world&rsquo;s fleet accompanying
      her towards eternity?

    <p>
      Margaret had often wondered at the disturbance that takes place in the
      world&rsquo;s waters, when Love, who seems so tiny a pebble, slips in. Whom does
      Love concern beyond the beloved and the lover? Yet his impact deluges a
      hundred shores. No doubt the disturbance is really the spirit of the
      generations, welcoming the new generation, and chafing against the
      ultimate Fate, who holds all the seas in the palm of her hand. But Love
      cannot understand this. He cannot comprehend another&rsquo;s infinity; he is
      conscious only of his own&mdash;flying sunbeam, falling rose, pebble that
      asks for one quiet plunge below the fretting interplay of space and time.
      He knows that he will survive at the end of things, and be gathered by
      Fate as a jewel from the slime, and be handed with admiration round the
      assembly of the gods. &ldquo;Men did produce this&rdquo; they will say, and, saying,
      they will give men immortality. But meanwhile&mdash;what agitations
      meanwhile! The foundations of Property and Propriety are laid bare, twin
      rocks; Family Pride flounders to the surface, puffing and blowing and
      refusing to be comforted; Theology, vaguely ascetic, gets up a nasty
      ground swell. Then the lawyers are aroused&mdash;cold brood&mdash;and
      creep out of their holes. They do what they can; they tidy up Property and
      Propriety, reassure Theology and Family Pride. Half-guineas are poured on
      the troubled waters, the lawyers creep back, and, if all has gone well,
      Love joins one man and woman together in Matrimony.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret had expected the disturbance, and was not irritated by it. For a
      sensitive woman she had steady nerves, and could bear with the incongruous
      and the grotesque; and, besides, there was nothing excessive about her
      love-affair. Good-humour was the dominant note of her relations with Mr.
      Wilcox, or, as I must now call him, Henry. Henry did not encourage
      romance, and she was no girl to fidget for it. An acquaintance had become
      a lover, might become a husband, but would retain all that she had noted
      in the acquaintance; and love must confirm an old relation rather than
      reveal a new one.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this spirit she promised to marry him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was in Swanage on the morrow bearing the engagement ring.
    </p>
    <p>
      They greeted one another with a hearty cordiality that impressed Aunt
      Juley. Henry dined at The Bays, but had engaged a bedroom in the principal
      hotel; he was one of those men who know the principal hotel by instinct.
      After dinner he asked Margaret if she wouldn&rsquo;t care for a turn on the
      Parade. She accepted, and could not repress a little tremor; it would be
      her first real love scene. But as she put on her hat she burst out
      laughing. Love was so unlike the article served up in books; the joy,
      though genuine was different; the mystery an unexpected mystery. For one
      thing, Mr. Wilcox still seemed a stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a time they talked about the ring; then she said: &ldquo;Do you remember the
      Embankment at Chelsea? It can&rsquo;t be ten days ago.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, laughing. &ldquo;And you and your sister were head and ears deep
      in some Quixotic scheme. Ah well!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I little thought then, certainly. Did you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that; I shouldn&rsquo;t like to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, was it earlier?&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Did you think of me this way earlier!
      How extraordinarily interesting, Henry! Tell me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Henry had no intention of telling. Perhaps he could not have told, for
      his mental states became obscure as soon as he had passed through them. He
      misliked the very word &ldquo;interesting,&rdquo; connoting it with wasted energy and
      even with morbidity. Hard facts were enough for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think of it,&rdquo; she pursued. &ldquo;No; when you spoke to me in the
      drawing-room, that was practically the first. It was all so different from
      what it&rsquo;s supposed to be. On the stage, or in books, a proposal is&mdash;how
      shall I put it?&mdash;a full-blown affair, a kind of bouquet; it loses its
      literal meaning. But in life a proposal really is a proposal&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the way&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
     <p>
     &ldquo;&mdash;a suggestion, a seed,&rdquo; she concluded; and the thought flew away
     into darkness.
     </p>
     <p>
     &ldquo;I was thinking, if you didn’t mind, that we ought to spend this evening
     in a business talk; there will be so much to settle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
    &ldquo;I think so too.  Tell me, in the first place, how did you get on with Tibby?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
    &ldquo;With your brother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
    &ldquo;Yes, during cigarettes.&rdquo;
     </p>
     <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, very well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am so glad,&rdquo; she answered, a little surprised. &ldquo;What did you talk
      about? Me, presumably.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About Greece too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Greece was a very good card, Henry. Tibby&rsquo;s only a boy still, and one has
      to pick and choose subjects a little. Well done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was telling him I have shares in a currant-farm near Calamata.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a delightful thing to have shares in! Can&rsquo;t we go there for our
      honeymoon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To eat the currants. And isn&rsquo;t there marvellous scenery?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Moderately, but it&rsquo;s not the kind of place one could possibly go to with
      a lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No hotels.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some ladies do without hotels. Are you aware that Helen and I have walked
      alone over the Apennines, with our luggage on our backs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t aware, and, if I can manage it, you will never do such a thing
      again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She said more gravely: &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t found time for a talk with Helen yet,
      I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do, before you go. I am so anxious you two should be friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your sister and I have always hit it off,&rdquo; he said negligently. &ldquo;But
      we&rsquo;re drifting away from our business. Let me begin at the beginning. You
      know that Evie is going to marry Percy Cahill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dolly&rsquo;s uncle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly. The girl&rsquo;s madly in love with him. A very good sort of fellow,
      but he demands&mdash;and rightly&mdash;a suitable provision with her. And
      in the second place you will naturally understand, there is Charles.
      Before leaving town, I wrote Charles a very careful letter. You see, he
      has an increasing family and increasing expenses, and the I. and W. A. is
      nothing particular just now, though capable of development.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor fellow!&rdquo; murmured Margaret, looking out to sea, and not
      understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Charles being the elder son, some day Charles will have Howards End; but
      I am anxious, in my own happiness, not to be unjust to others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; she began, and then gave a little cry. &ldquo;you mean money.
      How stupid I am! Of course not!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oddly enough, he winced a little at the word. &ldquo;Yes, Money, since you put
      it so frankly. I am determined to be just to all&mdash;just to you, just
      to them. I am determined that my children shall have me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be generous to them,&rdquo; she said sharply. &ldquo;Bother justice!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am determined&mdash;and have already written to Charles to that effect&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how much have you got?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much have you a year? I&rsquo;ve six hundred.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My income?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. We must begin with how much you have, before we can settle how much
      you can give Charles. Justice, and even generosity, depend on that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must say you&rsquo;re a downright young woman,&rdquo; he observed, patting her arm
      and laughing a little. &ldquo;What a question to spring on a fellow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know your income? Or don&rsquo;t you want to tell it me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right&rdquo;&mdash;now she patted him&mdash;&ldquo;don&rsquo;t tell me. I don&rsquo;t
      want to know. I can do the sum just as well by proportion. Divide your
      income into ten parts. How many parts would you give to Evie, how many to
      Charles, how many to Paul?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fact is, my dear, I hadn&rsquo;t any intention of bothering you with
      details. I only wanted to let you know that&mdash;well, that something
      must be done for the others, and you&rsquo;ve understood me perfectly, so let&rsquo;s
      pass on to the next point.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, we&rsquo;ve settled that,&rdquo; said Margaret, undisturbed by his strategic
      blunderings. &ldquo;Go ahead; give away all you can, bearing in mind that I&rsquo;ve a
      clear six hundred. What a mercy it is to have all this money about one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve none too much, I assure you; you&rsquo;re marrying a poor man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Helen wouldn&rsquo;t agree with me here,&rdquo; she continued. &ldquo;Helen daren&rsquo;t slang
      the rich, being rich herself, but she would like to. There&rsquo;s an odd
      notion, that I haven&rsquo;t yet got hold of, running about at the back of her
      brain, that poverty is somehow &lsquo;real.&rsquo; She dislikes all organisation, and
      probably confuses wealth with the technique of wealth. Sovereigns in a
      stocking wouldn&rsquo;t bother her; cheques do. Helen is too relentless. One
      can&rsquo;t deal in her high-handed manner with the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s this other point, and then I must go back to my hotel and write
      some letters. What&rsquo;s to be done now about the house in Ducie Street?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep it on&mdash;at least, it depends. When do you want to marry me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She raised her voice, as too often, and some youths, who were also taking
      the evening air, overheard her. &ldquo;Getting a bit hot, eh?&rdquo; said one. Mr.
      Wilcox turned on them, and said sharply, &ldquo;I say!&rdquo; There was silence. &ldquo;Take
      care I don&rsquo;t report you to the police.&rdquo; They moved away quietly enough,
      but were only biding their time, and the rest of the conversation was
      punctuated by peals of ungovernable laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lowering his voice and infusing a hint of reproof into it, he said: &ldquo;Evie
      will probably be married in September. We could scarcely think of anything
      before then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The earlier the nicer, Henry. Females are not supposed to say such
      things, but the earlier the nicer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How about September for us too?&rdquo; he asked, rather dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right. Shall we go into Ducie Street ourselves in September? Or shall we
      try to bounce Helen and Tibby into it? That&rsquo;s rather an idea. They are so
      unbusinesslike, we could make them do anything by judicious management.
      Look here&mdash;yes. We&rsquo;ll do that. And we ourselves could live at Howards
      End or Shropshire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He blew out his cheeks. &ldquo;Heavens! how you women do fly round! My head&rsquo;s in
      a whirl. Point by point, Margaret. Howards End&rsquo;s impossible. I let it to
      Hamar Bryce on a three years&rsquo; agreement last March. Don&rsquo;t you remember?
      Oniton. Well, that is much, much too far away to rely on entirely. You
      will be able to be down there entertaining a certain amount, but we must
      have a house within easy reach of Town. Only Ducie Street has huge
      drawbacks. There&rsquo;s a mews behind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret could not help laughing. It was the first she had heard of the
      mews behind Ducie Street. When she was a possible tenant it had suppressed
      itself, not consciously, but automatically. The breezy Wilcox manner,
      though genuine, lacked the clearness of vision that is imperative for
      truth. When Henry lived in Ducie Street he remembered the mews; when he
      tried to let he forgot it; and if any one had remarked that the mews must
      be either there or not, he would have felt annoyed, and afterwards have
      found some opportunity of stigmatising the speaker as academic. So does my
      grocer stigmatise me when I complain of the quality of his sultanas, and
      he answers in one breath that they are the best sultanas, and how can I
      expect the best sultanas at that price? It is a flaw inherent in the
      business mind, and Margaret may do well to be tender to it, considering
      all that the business mind has done for England.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, in summer especially, the mews is a serious nuisance. The
      smoking-room, too, is an abominable little den. The house opposite has
      been taken by operatic people. Ducie Street&rsquo;s going down, it&rsquo;s my private
      opinion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How sad! It&rsquo;s only a few years since they built those pretty houses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shows things are moving. Good for trade.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hate this continual flux of London. It is an epitome of us at our worst&mdash;eternal
      formlessness; all the qualities, good, bad, and indifferent, streaming
      away&mdash;streaming, streaming for ever. That&rsquo;s why I dread it so. I
      mistrust rivers, even in scenery. Now, the sea&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;High tide, yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hoy toid&rdquo;&mdash;from the promenading youths.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And these are the men to whom we give the vote,&rdquo; observed Mr. Wilcox,
      omitting to add that they were also the men to whom he gave work as clerks&mdash;work
      that scarcely encouraged them to grow into other men. &ldquo;However, they have
      their own lives and interests. Let&rsquo;s get on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned as he spoke, and prepared to see her back to The Bays. The
      business was over. His hotel was in the opposite direction, and if he
      accompanied her his letters would be late for the post. She implored him
      not to come, but he was obdurate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A nice beginning, if your aunt saw you slip in alone!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I always do go about alone. Considering I&rsquo;ve walked over the
      Apennines, it&rsquo;s common sense. You will make me so angry. I don&rsquo;t the least
      take it as a compliment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laughed, and lit a cigar. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t meant as a compliment, my dear. I
      just won&rsquo;t have you going about in the dark. Such people about too! It&rsquo;s
      dangerous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t I look after myself? I do wish&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come along, Margaret; no wheedling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A younger woman might have resented his masterly ways, but Margaret had
      too firm a grip of life to make a fuss. She was, in her own way, as
      masterly. If he was a fortress she was a mountain peak, whom all might
      tread, but whom the snows made nightly virginal. Disdaining the heroic
      outfit, excitable in her methods, garrulous, episodical, shrill, she
      misled her lover much as she had misled her aunt. He mistook her fertility
      for Weakness. He supposed her &ldquo;as clever as they make them,&rdquo; but no more,
      not realising that she was penetrating to the depths of his soul, and
      approving of what she found there.
    </p>
    <p>
      And if insight were sufficient, if the inner life were the whole of life,
      their happiness had been assured.
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked ahead briskly. The parade and the road after it were well
      lighted, but it was darker in Aunt Juley&rsquo;s garden. As they were going up
      by the side-paths, through some rhododendrons, Mr. Wilcox, who was in
      front, said &ldquo;Margaret&rdquo; rather huskily, turned, dropped his cigar, and took
      her in his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was startled, and nearly screamed, but recovered herself at once, and
      kissed with genuine love the lips that were pressed against her own. It
      was their first kiss, and when it was over he saw her safely to the door
      and rang the bell for her but disappeared into the night before the maid
      answered it. On looking back, the incident displeased her. It was so
      isolated. Nothing in their previous conversation had heralded it, and,
      worse still, no tenderness had ensued. If a man cannot lead up to passion
      he can at all events lead down from it, and she had hoped, after her
      complaisance, for some interchange of gentle words. But he had hurried
      away as if ashamed, and for an instant she was reminded of Helen and Paul.

      CHAPTER XXI
    </h2>
    <p>
      Charles had just been scolding his Dolly. She deserved the scolding, and
      had bent before it, but her head, though bloody was unsubdued and her
      chirrupings began to mingle with his retreating thunder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve waked the baby. I knew you would. (Rum-ti-foo,
      Rackety-tackety-Tompkin!) I&rsquo;m not responsible for what Uncle Percy does,
      nor for anybody else or anything, so there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who asked him while I was away? Who asked my sister down to meet him? Who
      sent them out in the motor day after day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Charles, that reminds me of some poem.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does it indeed? We shall all be dancing to a very different music
      presently. Miss Schlegel has fairly got us on toast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could simply scratch that woman&rsquo;s eyes out, and to say it&rsquo;s my fault is
      most unfair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s your fault, and five months ago you admitted it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tootle, tootle, playing on the pootle!&rdquo; exclaimed Dolly, suddenly
      devoting herself to the child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all very well to turn the conversation, but father would never have
      dreamt of marrying as long as Evie was there to make him comfortable. But
      you must needs start match-making. Besides, Cahill&rsquo;s too old.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, if you&rsquo;re going to be rude to Uncle Percy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Schlegel always meant to get hold of Howards End, and, thanks to
      you, she&rsquo;s got it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I call the way you twist things round and make them hang together most
      unfair. You couldn&rsquo;t have been nastier if you&rsquo;d caught me flirting. Could
      he, diddums?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re in a bad hole, and must make the best of it. I shall answer the
      pater&rsquo;s letter civilly. He&rsquo;s evidently anxious to do the decent thing. But
      I do not intend to forget these Schlegels in a hurry. As long as they&rsquo;re
      on their best behaviour&mdash;Dolly, are you listening?&mdash;we&rsquo;ll
      behave, too. But if I find them giving themselves airs or monopolising my
      father, or at all ill-treating him, or worrying him with their artistic
      beastliness, I intend to put my foot down, yes, firmly. Taking my mother&rsquo;s
      place! Heaven knows what poor old Paul will say when the news reaches
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The interlude closes. It has taken place in Charles&rsquo;s garden at Hilton. He
      and Dolly are sitting in deckchairs, and their motor is regarding them
      placidly from its garage across the lawn. A short-frocked edition of
      Charles also regards them placidly; a perambulator edition is squeaking; a
      third edition is expected shortly. Nature is turning out Wilcoxes in this
      peaceful abode, so that they may inherit the earth.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Margaret greeted her lord with peculiar tenderness on the morrow. Mature
      as he was, she might yet be able to help him to the building of the
      rainbow bridge that should connect the prose in us with the passion.
      Without it we are meaningless fragments, half monks, half beasts,
      unconnected arches that have never joined into a man. With it love is
      born, and alights on the highest curve, glowing against the grey, sober
      against the fire. Happy the man who sees from either aspect the glory of
      these outspread wings. The roads of his soul lie clear, and he and his
      friends shall find easy-going.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was hard-going in the roads of Mr. Wilcox&rsquo;s soul. From boyhood he had
      neglected them. &ldquo;I am not a fellow who bothers about my own inside.&rdquo;
       Outwardly he was cheerful, reliable, and brave; but within, all had
      reverted to chaos, ruled, so far as it was ruled at all, by an incomplete
      asceticism. Whether as boy, husband, or widower, he had always the
      sneaking belief that bodily passion is bad, a belief that is desirable
      only when held passionately. Religion had confirmed him. The words that
      were read aloud on Sunday to him and to other respectable men were the
      words that had once kindled the souls of St. Catherine and St. Francis
      into a white-hot hatred of the carnal. He could not be as the saints and
      love the Infinite with a seraphic ardour, but he could be a little ashamed
      of loving a wife. Amabat, amare timebat. And it was here that Margaret
      hoped to help him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It did not seem so difficult. She need trouble him with no gift of her
      own. She would only point out the salvation that was latent in his own
      soul, and in the soul of every man. Only connect! That was the whole of
      her sermon. Only connect the prose and the passion, and both will be
      exalted, and human love will be seen at its height. Live in fragments no
      longer. Only connect and the beast and the monk, robbed of the isolation
      that is life to either, will die.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor was the message difficult to give. It need not take the form of a good
      &ldquo;talking.&rdquo; By quiet indications the bridge would be built and span their
      lives with beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she failed. For there was one quality in Henry for which she was never
      prepared, however much she reminded herself of it: his obtuseness. He
      simply did not notice things, and there was no more to be said. He never
      noticed that Helen and Frieda were hostile, or that Tibby was not
      interested in currant plantations; he never noticed the lights and shades
      that exist in the greyest conversation, the finger-posts, the milestones,
      the collisions, the illimitable views. Once&mdash;on another occasion&mdash;she
      scolded him about it. He was puzzled, but replied with a laugh: &ldquo;My motto
      is Concentrate. I&rsquo;ve no intention of frittering away my strength on that
      sort of thing.&rdquo; &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t frittering away the strength,&rdquo; she protested.
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s enlarging the space in which you may be strong.&rdquo; He answered:
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a clever little woman, but my motto&rsquo;s Concentrate.&rdquo; And this
      morning he concentrated with a vengeance.
    </p>
    <p>
      They met in the rhododendrons of yesterday. In the daylight the bushes
      were inconsiderable and the path was bright in the morning sun. She was
      with Helen, who had been ominously quiet since the affair was settled.
      &ldquo;Here we all are!&rdquo; she cried, and took him by one hand, retaining her
      sister&rsquo;s in the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here we are. Good-morning, Helen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen replied, &ldquo;Good-morning, Mr. Wilcox.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Henry, she has had such a nice letter from the queer, cross boy. Do you
      remember him? He had a sad moustache, but the back of his head was young.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have had a letter too. Not a nice one&mdash;I want to talk it over with
      you&rdquo;; for Leonard Bast was nothing to him now that she had given him her
      word; the triangle of sex was broken for ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks to your hint, he&rsquo;s clearing out of the Porphyrion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a bad business that Porphyrion,&rdquo; he said absently, as he took his own
      letter out of his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a BAD&mdash;&rdquo; she exclaimed, dropping his hand. &ldquo;Surely, on Chelsea
      Embankment&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s our hostess. Good-morning, Mrs. Munt. Fine rhododendrons.
      Good-morning, Frau Liesecke; we manage to grow flowers in England, don&rsquo;t
      we?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a BAD business?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. My letter&rsquo;s about Howards End. Bryce has been ordered abroad, and
      wants to sublet it&mdash;I am far from sure that I shall give him
      permission. There was no clause in the agreement. In my opinion,
      subletting is a mistake. If he can find me another tenant, whom I consider
      suitable, I may cancel the agreement. Morning, Schlegel. Don&rsquo;t you think
      that&rsquo;s better than subletting?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen had dropped her hand now, and he had steered her past the whole
      party to the seaward side of the house. Beneath them was the bourgeois
      little bay, which must have yearned all through the centuries for just
      such a watering-place as Swanage to be built on its margin.
    </p>
    <p>
      The waves were colourless, and the Bournemouth steamer gave a further
      touch of insipidity, drawn up against the pier and hooting wildly for
      excursionists.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When there is a sublet I find that damage&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do excuse me, but about the Porphyrion. I don&rsquo;t feel easy&mdash;might I
      just bother you, Henry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her manner was so serious that he stopped, and asked her a little sharply
      what she wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said on Chelsea Embankment, surely, that it was a bad concern, so we
      advised this clerk to clear out. He writes this morning that he&rsquo;s taken
      our advice, and now you say it&rsquo;s not a bad concern.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A clerk who clears out of any concern, good or bad, without securing a
      berth somewhere else first, is a fool, and I&rsquo;ve no pity for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has not done that. He&rsquo;s going into a bank in Camden Town, he says. The
      salary&rsquo;s much lower, but he hopes to manage&mdash;a branch of Dempster&rsquo;s
      Bank. Is that all right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dempster! Why goodness me, yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More right than the Porphyrion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, yes; safe as houses&mdash;safer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very many thanks. I&rsquo;m sorry&mdash;if you sublet&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he sublets, I shan&rsquo;t have the same control. In theory there should be
      no more damage done at Howards End; in practice there will be. Things may
      be done for which no money can compensate. For instance, I shouldn&rsquo;t want
      that fine wych-elm spoilt. It hangs&mdash;Margaret, we must go and see the
      old place some time. It&rsquo;s pretty in its way. We&rsquo;ll motor down and have
      lunch with Charles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should enjoy that,&rdquo; said Margaret bravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about next Wednesday?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wednesday? No, I couldn&rsquo;t well do that. Aunt Juley expects us to stop
      here another week at least.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you can give that up now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Er&mdash;no,&rdquo; said Margaret, after a moment&rsquo;s thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;ll be all right. I&rsquo;ll speak to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This visit is a high solemnity. My aunt counts on it year after year. She
      turns the house upside down for us; she invites our special friends&mdash;she
      scarcely knows Frieda, and we can&rsquo;t leave her on her hands. I missed one
      day, and she would be so hurt if I didn&rsquo;t stay the full ten.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll say a word to her. Don&rsquo;t you bother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Henry, I won&rsquo;t go. Don&rsquo;t bully me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You want to see the house, though?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very much&mdash;I&rsquo;ve heard so much about it, one way or the other. Aren&rsquo;t
      there pigs&rsquo; teeth in the wych-elm?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;PIGS TEETH?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you chew the bark for toothache.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a rum notion! Of course not!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I have confused it with some other tree. There are still a great
      number of sacred trees in England, it seems.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he left her to intercept Mrs. Munt, whose voice could be heard in the
      distance; to be intercepted himself by Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh. Mr. Wilcox, about the Porphyrion&mdash;&rdquo; she began and went scarlet
      all over her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; called Margaret, catching them up. &ldquo;Dempster&rsquo;s Bank&rsquo;s
      better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I think you told us the Porphyrion was bad, and would smash before
      Christmas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did I? It was still outside the Tariff Ring, and had to take rotten
      policies. Lately it came in&mdash;safe as houses now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In other words, Mr. Bast need never have left it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, the fellow needn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;and needn&rsquo;t have started life elsewhere at a greatly reduced
      salary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He only says &lsquo;reduced,&rsquo;&rdquo; corrected Margaret, seeing trouble ahead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With a man so poor, every reduction must be great. I consider it a
      deplorable misfortune.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wilcox, intent on his business with Mrs. Munt, was going steadily on,
      but the last remark made him say: &ldquo;What? What&rsquo;s that? Do you mean that I&rsquo;m
      responsible?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re ridiculous, Helen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem to think&mdash;&rdquo; He looked at his watch. &ldquo;Let me explain the
      point to you. It is like this. You seem to assume, when a business concern
      is conducting a delicate negotiation, it ought to keep the public informed
      stage by stage. The Porphyrion, according to you, was bound to say, &lsquo;I am
      trying all I can to get into the Tariff Ring. I am not sure that I shall
      succeed, but it is the only thing that will save me from insolvency, and I
      am trying.&rsquo; My dear Helen&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that your point? A man who had little money has less&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am grieved for your clerk. But it is all in the day&rsquo;s work. It&rsquo;s part of
      the battle of life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man who had little money&mdash;&rdquo; she repeated, &ldquo;has less, owing to us.
      Under these circumstances I consider &lsquo;the battle of life&rsquo; a happy
      expression.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh come, come!&rdquo; he protested pleasantly, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re not to blame. No one&rsquo;s
      to blame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is no one to blame for anything?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t say that, but you&rsquo;re taking it far too seriously. Who is this
      fellow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have told you about the fellow twice already,&rdquo; said Helen. &ldquo;You have
      even met the fellow. He is very poor and his wife is an extravagant
      imbecile. He is capable of better things. We&mdash;we, the upper classes&mdash;thought
      we would help him from the height of our superior knowledge&mdash;and
      here&rsquo;s the result!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He raised his finger. &ldquo;Now, a word of advice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I require no more advice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A word of advice. Don&rsquo;t take up that sentimental attitude over the poor.
      See that she doesn&rsquo;t, Margaret. The poor are poor, and one&rsquo;s sorry for
      them, but there it is. As civilisation moves forward, the shoe is bound to
      pinch in places, and it&rsquo;s absurd to pretend that any one is responsible
      personally. Neither you, nor I, nor my informant, nor the man who informed
      him, nor the directors of the Porphyrion, are to blame for this clerk&rsquo;s
      loss of salary. It&rsquo;s just the shoe pinching&mdash;no one can help it; and
      it might easily have been worse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen quivered with indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By all means subscribe to charities&mdash;subscribe to them largely&mdash;but
      don&rsquo;t get carried away by absurd schemes of Social Reform. I see a good
      deal behind the scenes, and you can take it from me that there is no
      Social Question&mdash;except for a few journalists who try to get a living
      out of the phrase. There are just rich and poor, as there always have been
      and always will be. Point me out a time when men have been equal&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Point me out a time when desire for equality has made them happier. No,
      no. You can&rsquo;t. There always have been rich and poor. I&rsquo;m no fatalist.
      Heaven forbid! But our civilisation is moulded by great impersonal forces&rdquo;
       (his voice grew complacent; it always did when he eliminated the
      personal), &ldquo;and there always will be rich and poor. You can&rsquo;t deny it&rdquo;
       (and now it was a respectful voice)&mdash;&ldquo;and you can&rsquo;t deny that, in
      spite of all, the tendency of civilisation has on the whole been upward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Owing to God, I suppose,&rdquo; flashed Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stared at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You grab the dollars. God does the rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was no good instructing the girl if she was going to talk about God in
      that neurotic modern way. Fraternal to the last, he left her for the
      quieter company of Mrs. Munt. He thought, &ldquo;She rather reminds me of
      Dolly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen looked out at the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ever discuss political economy with Henry,&rdquo; advised her sister.
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll only end in a cry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he must be one of those men who have reconciled science with
      religion,&rdquo; said Helen slowly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like those men. They are scientific
      themselves, and talk of the survival of the fittest, and cut down the
      salaries of their clerks, and stunt the independence of all who may menace
      their comfort, but yet they believe that somehow good&mdash;it is always
      that sloppy &lsquo;somehow&rsquo; will be the outcome, and that in some mystical way
      the Mr. Basts of the future will benefit because the Mr. Brits of today
      are in pain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is such a man in theory. But oh, Helen, in theory!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But oh, Meg, what a theory!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should you put things so bitterly, dearie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I&rsquo;m an old maid,&rdquo; said Helen, biting her lip. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think why
      I go on like this myself.&rdquo; She shook off her sister&rsquo;s hand and went into
      the house. Margaret, distressed at the day&rsquo;s beginning, followed the
      Bournemouth steamer with her eyes. She saw that Helen&rsquo;s nerves were
      exasperated by the unlucky Bast business beyond the bounds of politeness.
      There might at any minute be a real explosion, which even Henry would
      notice. Henry must be removed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Margaret!&rdquo; her aunt called. &ldquo;Magsy! It isn&rsquo;t true, surely, what Mr.
      Wilcox says, that you want to go away early next week?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not &lsquo;want,&rsquo;&rdquo; was Margaret&rsquo;s prompt reply; &ldquo;but there is so much to be
      settled, and I do want to see the Charles&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But going away without taking the Weymouth trip, or even the Lulworth?&rdquo;
       said Mrs. Munt, coming nearer. &ldquo;Without going once more up Nine Barrows
      Down?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wilcox rejoined her with, &ldquo;Good! I did the breaking of the ice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A wave of tenderness came over her. She put a hand on either shoulder, and
      looked deeply into the black, bright eyes. What was behind their competent
      stare? She knew, but was not disquieted.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Margaret had no intention of letting things slide, and the evening before
      she left Swanage she gave her sister a thorough scolding. She censured
      her, not for disapproving of the engagement, but for throwing over her
      disapproval a veil of mystery. Helen was equally frank. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said,
      with the air of one looking inwards, &ldquo;there is a mystery. I can&rsquo;t help it.
      It&rsquo;s not my fault. It&rsquo;s the way life has been made.&rdquo; Helen in those days
      was over-interested in the subconscious self. She exaggerated the Punch
      and Judy aspect of life, and spoke of mankind as puppets, whom an
      invisible showman twitches into love and war. Margaret pointed out that if
      she dwelt on this she, too, would eliminate the personal. Helen was silent
      for a minute, and then burst into a queer speech, which cleared the air.
      &ldquo;Go on and marry him. I think you&rsquo;re splendid; and if any one can pull it
      off, you will.&rdquo; Margaret denied that there was anything to &ldquo;pull off,&rdquo; but
      she continued: &ldquo;Yes, there is, and I wasn&rsquo;t up to it with Paul. I can do
      only what&rsquo;s easy. I can only entice and be enticed. I can&rsquo;t, and won&rsquo;t,
      attempt difficult relations. If I marry, it will either be a man who&rsquo;s
      strong enough to boss me or whom I&rsquo;m strong enough to boss. So I shan&rsquo;t
      ever marry, for there aren&rsquo;t such men. And Heaven help any one whom I do
      marry, for I shall certainly run away from him before you can say &lsquo;Jack
      Robinson.&rsquo; There! Because I&rsquo;m uneducated. But you, you&rsquo;re different;
      you&rsquo;re a heroine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Helen! Am I? Will it be as dreadful for poor Henry as all that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean to keep proportion, and that&rsquo;s heroic, it&rsquo;s Greek, and I don&rsquo;t
      see why it shouldn&rsquo;t succeed with you. Go on and fight with him and help
      him. Don&rsquo;t ask me for help, or even for sympathy. Henceforward I&rsquo;m going
      my own way. I mean to be thorough, because thoroughness is easy. I mean to
      dislike your husband, and to tell him so. I mean to make no concessions to
      Tibby. If Tibby wants to live with me, he must lump me. I mean to love you
      more than ever. Yes, I do. You and I have built up something real, because
      it is purely spiritual. There&rsquo;s no veil of mystery over us. Unreality and
      mystery begin as soon as one touches the body. The popular view is, as
      usual, exactly the wrong one. Our bothers are over tangible things&mdash;money,
      husbands, house-hunting. But Heaven will work of itself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret was grateful for this expression of affection, and answered,
      &ldquo;Perhaps.&rdquo; All vistas close in the unseen&mdash;no one doubts it&mdash;but
      Helen closed them rather too quickly for her taste. At every turn of
      speech one was confronted with reality and the absolute. Perhaps Margaret
      grew too old for metaphysics, perhaps Henry was weaning her from them, but
      she felt that there was something a little unbalanced in the mind that so
      readily shreds the visible. The business man who assumes that this life is
      everything, and the mystic who asserts that it is nothing, fail, on this
      side and on that, to hit the truth. &ldquo;Yes, I see, dear; it&rsquo;s about half-way
      between,&rdquo; Aunt Juley had hazarded in earlier years. No; truth, being
      alive, was not half-way between anything. It was only to be found by
      continuous excursions into either realm, and though proportion is the
      final secret, to espouse it at the outset is to insure sterility.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen, agreeing here, disagreeing there, would have talked till midnight,
      but Margaret, with her packing to do, focussed the conversation on Henry.
      She might abuse Henry behind his back, but please would she always be
      civil to him in company? &ldquo;I definitely dislike him, but I&rsquo;ll do what I
      can,&rdquo; promised Helen. &ldquo;Do what you can with my friends in return.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This conversation made Margaret easier. Their inner life was so safe that
      they could bargain over externals in a way that would have been incredible
      to Aunt Juley, and impossible for Tibby or Charles. There are moments when
      the inner life actually &ldquo;pays,&rdquo; when years of self-scrutiny, conducted for
      no ulterior motive, are suddenly of practical use. Such moments are still
      rare in the West; that they come at all promises a fairer future.
      Margaret, though unable to understand her sister, was assured against
      estrangement, and returned to London with a more peaceful mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following morning, at eleven o&rsquo;clock, she presented herself at the
      offices of the Imperial and West African Rubber Company. She was glad to
      go there, for Henry had implied his business rather than described it, and
      the formlessness and vagueness that one associates with Africa itself had
      hitherto brooded over the main sources of his wealth. Not that a visit to
      the office cleared things up. There was just the ordinary surface scum of
      ledgers and polished counters and brass bars that began and stopped for no
      possible reason, of electric-light globes blossoming in triplets, of
      little rabbit-hutches faced with glass or wire, of little rabbits. And
      even when she penetrated to the inner depths, she found only the ordinary
      table and Turkey carpet, and though the map over the fireplace did depict
      a helping of West Africa, it was a very ordinary map. Another map hung
      opposite, on which the whole continent appeared, looking like a whale
      marked out for a blubber, and by its side was a door, shut, but Henry&rsquo;s
      voice came through it, dictating a &ldquo;strong&rdquo; letter. She might have been at
      the Porphyrion, or Dempster&rsquo;s Bank, or her own wine-merchant&rsquo;s. Everything
      seems just alike in these days. But perhaps she was seeing the Imperial
      side of the company rather than its West African, and Imperialism always
      had been one of her difficulties.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One minute!&rdquo; called Mr. Wilcox on receiving her name. He touched a bell,
      the effect of which was to produce Charles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charles had written his father an adequate letter&mdash;more adequate than
      Evie&rsquo;s, through which a girlish indignation throbbed. And he greeted his
      future stepmother with propriety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope that my wife&mdash;how do you do?&mdash;will give you a decent
      lunch,&rdquo; was his opening. &ldquo;I left instructions, but we live in a
      rough-and-ready way. She expects you back to tea, too, after you have had
      a look at Howards End. I wonder what you&rsquo;ll think of the place. I wouldn&rsquo;t
      touch it with tongs myself. Do sit down! It&rsquo;s a measly little place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall enjoy seeing it,&rdquo; said Margaret, feeling, for the first time,
      shy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see it at its worst, for Bryce decamped abroad last Monday without
      even arranging for a charwoman to clear up after him. I never saw such a
      disgraceful mess. It&rsquo;s unbelievable. He wasn&rsquo;t in the house a month.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve more than a little bone to pick with Bryce,&rdquo; called Henry from the
      inner chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did he go so suddenly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Invalid type; couldn&rsquo;t sleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor fellow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor fiddlesticks!&rdquo; said Mr. Wilcox, joining them. &ldquo;He had the impudence
      to put up notice-boards without as much as saying with your leave or by
      your leave. Charles flung them down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I flung them down,&rdquo; said Charles modestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve sent a telegram after him, and a pretty sharp one, too. He, and he
      in person, is responsible for the upkeep of that house for the next three
      years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The keys are at the farm; we wouldn&rsquo;t have the keys.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dolly would have taken them, but I was in, fortunately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s Mr. Bryce like?&rdquo; asked Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      But nobody cared. Mr. Bryce was the tenant, who had no right to sublet; to
      have defined him further was a waste of time. On his misdeeds they
      descanted profusely, until the girl who had been typing the strong letter
      came out with it. Mr. Wilcox added his signature. &ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ll be off,&rdquo; said
      he.
    </p>
    <p>
      A motor-drive, a form of felicity detested by Margaret, awaited her.
      Charles saw them in, civil to the last, and in a moment the offices of the
      Imperial and West African Rubber Company faded away. But it was not an
      impressive drive. Perhaps the weather was to blame, being grey and banked
      high with weary clouds. Perhaps Hertfordshire is scarcely intended for
      motorists. Did not a gentleman once motor so quickly through Westmoreland
      that he missed it? and if Westmoreland can be missed, it will fare ill
      with a county whose delicate structure particularly needs the attentive
      eye. Hertfordshire is England at its quietest, with little emphasis of
      river and hill; it is England meditative. If Drayton were with us again to
      write a new edition of his incomparable poem, he would sing the nymphs of
      Hertfordshire as indeterminate of feature, with hair obfuscated by the
      London smoke. Their eyes would be sad, and averted from their fate towards
      the Northern flats, their leader not Isis or Sabrina, but the slowly
      flowing Lea. No glory of raiment would be theirs, no urgency of dance; but
      they would be real nymphs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chauffeur could not travel as quickly as he had hoped, for the Great
      North Road was full of Easter traffic. But he went quite quick enough for
      Margaret, a poor-spirited creature, who had chickens and children on the
      brain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re all right,&rdquo; said Mr. Wilcox. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll learn&mdash;like the
      swallows and the telegraph-wires.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but, while they&rsquo;re learning&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The motor&rsquo;s come to stay,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;One must get about. There&rsquo;s a
      pretty church&mdash;oh, you aren&rsquo;t sharp enough. Well, look out, if the
      road worries you&mdash;right outward at the scenery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at the scenery. It heaved and merged like porridge. Presently
      it congealed. They had arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charles&rsquo;s house on the left; on the right the swelling forms of the Six
      Hills. Their appearance in such a neighbourhood surprised her. They
      interrupted the stream of residences that was thickening up towards
      Hilton. Beyond them she saw meadows and a wood, and beneath them she
      settled that soldiers of the best kind lay buried. She hated war and liked
      soldiers&mdash;it was one of her amiable inconsistencies.
    </p>
    <p>
      But here was Dolly, dressed up to the nines, standing at the door to greet
      them, and here were the first drops of the rain. They ran in gaily, and
      after a long wait in the drawing-room, sat down to the rough-and-ready
      lunch, every dish of which concealed or exuded cream. Mr. Bryce was the
      chief topic of conversation. Dolly described his visit with the key, while
      her father-in-law gave satisfaction by chaffing her and contradicting all
      she said. It was evidently the custom to laugh at Dolly. He chaffed
      Margaret too, and Margaret roused from a grave meditation was pleased and
      chaffed him back. Dolly seemed surprised and eyed her curiously. After
      lunch the two children came down. Margaret disliked babies, but hit it off
      better with the two-year-old, and sent Dolly into fits of laughter by
      talking sense to him. &ldquo;Kiss them now, and come away,&rdquo; said Mr. Wilcox. She
      came, but refused to kiss them; it was such hard luck on the little
      things, she said, and though Dolly proffered Chorly-worly and
      Porgly-woggles in turn, she was obdurate.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time it was raining steadily. The car came round with the hood up,
      and again she lost all sense of space. In a few minutes they stopped, and
      Crane opened the door of the car.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s happened?&rdquo; asked Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you suppose?&rdquo; said Henry.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little porch was close up against her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are we there already?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I never! In years ago it seemed so far away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Smiling, but somehow disillusioned, she jumped out, and her impetus
      carried her to the front-door. She was about to open it, when Henry said:
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s no good; it&rsquo;s locked. Who&rsquo;s got the key?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he had himself forgotten to call for the key at the farm, no one
      replied. He also wanted to know who had left the front gate open, since a
      cow had strayed in from the road, and was spoiling the croquet lawn. Then
      he said rather crossly: &ldquo;Margaret, you wait in the dry. I&rsquo;ll go down for
      the key. It isn&rsquo;t a hundred yards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mayn&rsquo;t I come too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I shall be back before I&rsquo;m gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then the car turned away, and it was as if a curtain had risen. For the
      second time that day she saw the appearance of the earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were the greengage-trees that Helen had once described, there the
      tennis lawn, there the hedge that would be glorious with dog-roses in
      June, but the vision now was of black and palest green. Down by the
      dell-hole more vivid colours were awakening, and Lent lilies stood
      sentinel on its margin, or advanced in battalions over the grass. Tulips
      were a tray of jewels. She could not see the wych-elm tree, but a branch
      of the celebrated vine, studded with velvet knobs had covered the perch.
      She was struck by the fertility of the soil; she had seldom been in a
      garden where the flowers looked so well, and even the weeds she was idly
      plucking out of the porch were intensely green. Why had poor Mr. Bryce
      fled from all this beauty? For she had already decided that the place was
      beautiful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naughty cow! Go away!&rdquo; cried Margaret to the cow, but without
      indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harder came the rain, pouring out of a windless sky, and spattering up
      from the notice-boards of the house-agents, which lay in a row on the lawn
      where Charles had hurled them. She must have interviewed Charles in
      another world&mdash;where one did have interviews. How Helen would revel
      in such a notion! Charles dead, all people dead, nothing alive but houses
      and gardens. The obvious dead, the intangible alive, and no connection at
      all between them! Margaret smiled. Would that her own fancies were as
      clear-cut! Would that she could deal as high-handedly with the world!
      Smiling and sighing, she laid her hand upon the door. It opened. The house
      was not locked up at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      She hesitated. Ought she to wait for Henry? He felt strongly about
      property, and might prefer to show her over himself. On the other hand, he
      had told her to keep in the dry, and the porch was beginning to drip. So
      she went in, and the draught from inside slammed the door behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Desolation greeted her. Dirty finger-prints were on the hall-windows, flue
      and rubbish on its unwashed boards. The civilisation of luggage had been
      here for a month, and then decamped. Dining-room and drawing-room&mdash;right
      and left&mdash;were guessed only by their wallpapers. They were just rooms
      where one could shelter from the rain. Across the ceiling of each ran a
      great beam. The dining-room and hall revealed theirs openly, but the
      drawing-room&rsquo;s was match-boarded&mdash;because the facts of life must be
      concealed from ladies? Drawing-room, dining-room, and hall&mdash;how petty
      the names sounded! Here were simply three rooms where children could play
      and friends shelter from the rain. Yes, and they were beautiful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she opened one of the doors opposite&mdash;there were two&mdash;and
      exchanged wall-papers for whitewash. It was the servants&rsquo; part, though she
      scarcely realised that: just rooms again, where friends might shelter. The
      garden at the back was full of flowering cherries and plums. Farther on
      were hints of the meadow and a black cliff of pines. Yes, the meadow was
      beautiful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Penned in by the desolate weather, she recaptured the sense of space which
      the motor had tried to rob from her. She remembered again that ten square
      miles are not ten times as wonderful as one square mile, that a thousand
      square miles are not practically the same as heaven. The phantom of
      bigness, which London encourages, was laid for ever when she paced from
      the hall at Howards End to its kitchen and heard the rain run this way and
      that where the watershed of the roof divided it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Helen came to her mind, scrutinising half Wessex from the ridge of the
      Purbeck Downs, and saying: &ldquo;You will have to lose something.&rdquo; She was not
      so sure. For instance she would double her kingdom by opening the door
      that concealed the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now she thought of the map of Africa; of empires; of her father; of the
      two supreme nations, streams of whose life warmed her blood, but,
      mingling, had cooled her brain. She paced back into the hall, and as she
      did so the house reverberated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that you, Henry?&rdquo; she called.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no answer, but the house reverberated again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Henry, have you got in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But it was the heart of the house beating, faintly at first, then loudly,
      martially. It dominated the rain.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is the starved imagination, not the well-nourished, that is afraid.
      Margaret flung open the door to the stairs. A noise as of drums seemed to
      deafen her. A woman, an old woman, was descending, with figure erect, with
      face impassive, with lips that parted and said dryly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Well, I took you for Ruth Wilcox.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret stammered: &ldquo;I&mdash;Mrs. Wilcox&mdash;I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In fancy, of course&mdash;in fancy. You had her way of walking.
      Good-day.&rdquo; And the old woman passed out into the rain.

      CHAPTER XXIV
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It gave her quite a turn,&rdquo; said Mr. Wilcox, when retailing the incident
      to Dolly at tea-time. &ldquo;None of you girls have any nerves, really. Of
      course, a word from me put it all right, but silly old Miss Avery&mdash;she
      frightened you, didn&rsquo;t she, Margaret? There you stood clutching a bunch of
      weeds. She might have said something, instead of coming down the stairs
      with that alarming bonnet on. I passed her as I came in. Enough to make
      the car shy. I believe Miss Avery goes in for being a character; some old
      maids do.&rdquo; He lit a cigarette. &ldquo;It is their last resource. Heaven knows
      what she was doing in the place; but that&rsquo;s Bryce&rsquo;s business, not mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t as foolish as you suggest,&rdquo; said Margaret &ldquo;She only startled me,
      for the house had been silent so long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you take her for a spook?&rdquo; asked Dolly, for whom &ldquo;spooks&rdquo;&rsquo; and &ldquo;going
      to church&rdquo; summarised the unseen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not exactly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She really did frighten you,&rdquo; said Henry, who was far from discouraging
      timidity in females. &ldquo;Poor Margaret! And very naturally. Uneducated
      classes are so stupid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Miss Avery uneducated classes?&rdquo; Margaret asked, and found herself
      looking at the decoration scheme of Dolly&rsquo;s drawing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s just one of the crew at the farm. People like that always assume
      things. She assumed you&rsquo;d know who she was. She left all the Howards End
      keys in the front lobby, and assumed that you&rsquo;d seen them as you came in,
      that you&rsquo;d lock up the house when you&rsquo;d done, and would bring them on down
      to her. And there was her niece hunting for them down at the farm. Lack of
      education makes people very casual. Hilton was full of women like Miss
      Avery once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t have disliked it, perhaps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or Miss Avery giving me a wedding present,&rdquo; said Dolly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Which was illogical but interesting. Through Dolly, Margaret was destined
      to learn a good deal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Charles said I must try not to mind, because she had known his
      grandmother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As usual, you&rsquo;ve got the story wrong, my good Dorothea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I meant great-grandmother&mdash;the one who left Mrs. Wilcox the house.
      Weren&rsquo;t both of them and Miss Avery friends when Howards End, too, was a
      farm?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her father-in-law blew out a shaft of smoke. His attitude to his dead wife
      was curious. He would allude to her, and hear her discussed, but never
      mentioned her by name. Nor was he interested in the dim, bucolic past.
      Dolly was&mdash;for the following reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then hadn&rsquo;t Mrs. Wilcox a brother&mdash;or was it an uncle? Anyhow, he
      popped the question, and Miss Avery, she said &lsquo;No.&rsquo; Just imagine, if she&rsquo;d
      said &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; she would have been Charles&rsquo;s aunt. (Oh, I say, that&rsquo;s rather
      good! &lsquo;Charlie&rsquo;s Aunt&rsquo;! I must chaff him about that this evening.) And the
      man went out and was killed. Yes, I&rsquo;m certain I&rsquo;ve got it right now. Tom
      Howard&mdash;he was the last of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe so,&rdquo; said Mr. Wilcox negligently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say! Howards End&mdash;Howards Ended!&rdquo; cried Dolly.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m rather on the spot this evening, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d ask whether Crane&rsquo;s ended.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Mr. Wilcox, how can you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because, if he has had enough tea, we ought to go&mdash;Dolly&rsquo;s a good
      little woman,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;but a little of her goes a long way. I
      couldn&rsquo;t live near her if you paid me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret smiled. Though presenting a firm front to outsiders, no Wilcox
      could live near, or near the possessions of, any other Wilcox. They had
      the colonial spirit, and were always making for some spot where the white
      man might carry his burden unobserved. Of course, Howards End was
      impossible, so long as the younger couple were established in Hilton. His
      objections to the house were plain as daylight now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crane had had enough tea, and was sent to the garage, where their car had
      been trickling muddy water over Charles&rsquo;s. The downpour had surely
      penetrated the Six Hills by now, bringing news of our restless
      civilisation. &ldquo;Curious mounds,&rdquo; said Henry, &ldquo;but in with you now; another
      time.&rdquo; He had to be up in London by seven&mdash;if possible, by
      six-thirty. Once more she lost the sense of space; once more trees,
      houses, people, animals, hills, merged and heaved into one dirtiness, and
      she was at Wickham Place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her evening was pleasant. The sense of flux which had haunted her all the
      year disappeared for a time. She forgot the luggage and the motor-cars,
      and the hurrying men who know so much and connect so little. She
      recaptured the sense of space, which is the basis of all earthly beauty,
      and, starting from Howards End, she attempted to realise England. She
      failed&mdash;visions do not come when we try, though they may come through
      trying. But an unexpected love of the island awoke in her, connecting on
      this side with the joys of the flesh, on that with the inconceivable.
      Helen and her father had known this love, poor Leonard Bast was groping
      after it, but it had been hidden from Margaret till this afternoon. It had
      certainly come through the house and old Miss Avery. Through them: the
      notion of &ldquo;through&rdquo; persisted; her mind trembled towards a conclusion
      which only the unwise have put into words. Then, veering back into warmth,
      it dwelt on ruddy bricks, flowering plum-trees, and all the tangible joys
      of spring.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry, after allaying her agitation, had taken her over his property, and
      had explained to her the use and dimensions of the various rooms. He had
      sketched the history of the little estate. &ldquo;It is so unlucky,&rdquo; ran the
      monologue, &ldquo;that money wasn&rsquo;t put into it about fifty years ago. Then it
      had four&mdash;five&mdash;times the land&mdash;thirty acres at least. One
      could have made something out of it then&mdash;a small park, or at all
      events shrubberies, and rebuilt the house farther away from the road.
      What&rsquo;s the good of taking it in hand now? Nothing but the meadow left, and
      even that was heavily mortgaged when I first had to do with things&mdash;yes,
      and the house too. Oh, it was no joke.&rdquo; She saw two women as he spoke, one
      old, the other young, watching their inheritance melt away. She saw them
      greet him as a deliverer. &ldquo;Mismanagement did it&mdash;besides, the days
      for small farms are over. It doesn&rsquo;t pay&mdash;except with intensive
      cultivation. Small holdings, back to the land&mdash;ah! philanthropic
      bunkum. Take it as a rule that nothing pays on a small scale. Most of the
      land you see (they were standing at an upper window, the only one which
      faced west) belongs to the people at the Park&mdash;they made their pile
      over copper&mdash;good chaps. Avery&rsquo;s Farm, Sishe&rsquo;s&mdash;what they call
      the Common, where you see that ruined oak&mdash;one after the other fell
      in, and so did this, as near as is no matter.&rdquo; But Henry had saved it;
      without fine feelings or deep insight, but he had saved it, and she loved
      him for the deed. &ldquo;When I had more control I did what I could&mdash;sold
      off the two and a half animals, and the mangy pony, and the superannuated
      tools; pulled down the outhouses; drained; thinned out I don&rsquo;t know how
      many guelder-roses and elder-trees; and inside the house I turned the old
      kitchen into a hall, and made a kitchen behind where the dairy was. Garage
      and so on came later. But one could still tell it&rsquo;s been an old farm. And
      yet it isn&rsquo;t the place that would fetch one of your artistic crew.&rdquo; No, it
      wasn&rsquo;t; and if he did not quite understand it, the artistic crew would
      still less; it was English, and the wych-elm that she saw from the window
      was an English tree. No report had prepared her for its peculiar glory. It
      was neither warrior, nor lover, nor god; in none of these roles do the
      English excel. It was a comrade bending over the house, strength and
      adventure in its roots, but in its utmost fingers tenderness, and the
      girth, that a dozen men could not have spanned, became in the end
      evanescent, till pale bud clusters seemed to float in the air. It was a
      comrade. House and tree transcended any similes of sex. Margaret thought
      of them now, and was to think of them through many a windy night and
      London day, but to compare either to man, to woman, always dwarfed the
      vision. Yet they kept within limits of the human. Their message was not of
      eternity, but of hope on this side of the grave. As she stood in the one,
      gazing at the other, truer relationship had gleamed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another touch, and the account of her day is finished. They entered the
      garden for a minute, and to Mr. Wilcox&rsquo;s surprise she was right. Teeth,
      pigs&rsquo; teeth, could be seen in the bark of the wych-elm tree&mdash;just the
      white tips of them showing. &ldquo;Extraordinary!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Who told you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard of it one winter in London,&rdquo; was her answer, for she, too,
      avoided mentioning Mrs. Wilcox by name.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXV
    </h2>
    <p>
      Evie heard of her father&rsquo;s engagement when she was in for a tennis
      tournament, and her play went simply to pot. That she should marry and
      leave him had seemed natural enough; that he, left alone, should do the
      same was deceitful; and now Charles and Dolly said that it was all her
      fault. &ldquo;But I never dreamt of such a thing,&rdquo; she grumbled. &ldquo;Dad took me to
      call now and then, and made me ask her to Simpson&rsquo;s. Well, I&rsquo;m altogether
      off dad.&rdquo; It was also an insult to their mother&rsquo;s memory; there they were
      agreed, and Evie had the idea of returning Mrs. Wilcox&rsquo;s lace and
      jewellery &ldquo;as a protest.&rdquo; Against what it would protest she was not clear;
      but being only eighteen, the idea of renunciation appealed to her, the
      more as she did not care for jewellery or lace. Dolly then suggested that
      she and Uncle Percy should pretend to break off their engagement, and then
      perhaps Mr. Wilcox would quarrel with Miss Schlegel, and break off his; or
      Paul might be cabled for. But at this point Charles told them not to talk
      nonsense. So Evie settled to marry as soon as possible; it was no good
      hanging about with these Schlegels eyeing her. The date of her wedding was
      consequently put forward from September to August, and in the intoxication
      of presents she recovered much of her good-humour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret found that she was expected to figure at this function, and to
      figure largely; it would be such an opportunity, said Henry, for her to
      get to know his set. Sir James Bidder would be there, and all the Cahills
      and the Fussells, and his sister-in-law, Mrs. Warrington Wilcox, had
      fortunately got back from her tour round the world. Henry she loved, but
      his set promised to be another matter. He had not the knack of surrounding
      himself with nice people&mdash;indeed, for a man of ability and virtue his
      choice had been singularly unfortunate; he had no guiding principle beyond
      a certain preference for mediocrity; he was content to settle one of the
      greatest things in life haphazard, and so, while his investments went
      right, his friends generally went wrong. She would be told, &ldquo;Oh,
      So-and-so&rsquo;s a good sort&mdash;a thundering good sort,&rdquo; and find, on
      meeting him, that he was a brute or a bore. If Henry had shown real
      affection, she would have understood, for affection explains everything.
      But he seemed without sentiment. The &ldquo;thundering good sort&rdquo; might at any
      moment become &ldquo;a fellow for whom I never did have much use, and have less
      now,&rdquo; and be shaken off cheerily into oblivion. Margaret had done the same
      as a schoolgirl. Now she never forgot any one for whom she had once cared;
      she connected, though the connection might be bitter, and she hoped that
      some day Henry would do the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      Evie was not to be married from Ducie Street. She had a fancy for
      something rural, and, besides, no one would be in London then, so she left
      her boxes for a few weeks at Oniton Grange, and her banns were duly
      published in the parish church, and for a couple of days the little town,
      dreaming between the ruddy hills, was roused by the clang of our
      civilisation, and drew up by the roadside to let the motors pass. Oniton
      had been a discovery of Mr. Wilcox&rsquo;s&mdash;a discovery of which he was not
      altogether proud. It was up towards the Welsh border, and so difficult of
      access that he had concluded it must be something special. A ruined castle
      stood in the grounds. But having got there, what was one to do? The
      shooting was bad, the fishing indifferent, and womenfolk reported the
      scenery as nothing much. The place turned out to be in the wrong part of
      Shropshire, and though he never ran down his own property to others, he
      was only waiting to get it off his hands, and then to let fly. Evie&rsquo;s
      marriage was its last appearance in public. As soon as a tenant was found,
      it became a house for which he never had had much use, and had less now,
      and, like Howards End, faded into Limbo.
    </p>
    <p>
      But on Margaret Oniton was destined to make a lasting impression. She
      regarded it as her future home, and was anxious to start straight with the
      clergy, etc., and, if possible, to see something of the local life. It was
      a market-town&mdash;as tiny a one as England possesses&mdash;and had for
      ages served that lonely valley, and guarded our marches against the Celt.
      In spite of the occasion, in spite of the numbing hilarity that greeted
      her as soon as she got into the reserved saloon at Paddington, her senses
      were awake and watching, and though Oniton was to prove one of her
      innumerable false starts, she never forgot it, or the things that happened
      there.
    </p>
    <p>
      The London party only numbered eight&mdash;the Fussells, father and son,
      two Anglo-Indian ladies named Mrs. Plynlimmon and Lady Edser, Mrs.
      Warrington Wilcox and her daughter, and, lastly, the little girl, very
      smart and quiet, who figures at so many weddings, and who kept a watchful
      eye on Margaret, the bride-elect. Dolly was absent&mdash;a domestic event
      detained her at Hilton; Paul had cabled a humorous message; Charles was to
      meet them with a trio of motors at Shrewsbury; Helen had refused her
      invitation; Tibby had never answered his. The management was excellent, as
      was to be expected with anything that Henry undertook; one was conscious
      of his sensible and generous brain in the background. They were his guests
      as soon as they reached the train; a special label for their luggage; a
      courier; a special lunch; they had only to look pleasant and, where
      possible, pretty. Margaret thought with dismay of her own nuptials&mdash;presumably
      under the management of Tibby. &ldquo;Mr. Theobald Schlegel and Miss Helen
      Schlegel request the pleasure of Mrs. Plynlimmon&rsquo;s company on the occasion
      of the marriage of their sister Margaret.&rdquo; The formula was incredible, but
      it must soon be printed and sent, and though Wickham Place need not
      compete with Oniton, it must feed its guests properly, and provide them
      with sufficient chairs. Her wedding would either be ramshackly or
      bourgeois&mdash;she hoped the latter. Such an affair as the present,
      staged with a deftness that was almost beautiful, lay beyond her powers
      and those of her friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      The low rich purr of a Great Western express is not the worst background
      for conversation, and the journey passed pleasantly enough. Nothing could
      have exceeded the kindness of the two men. They raised windows for some
      ladies, and lowered them for others, they rang the bell for the servant,
      they identified the colleges as the train slipped past Oxford, they caught
      books or bag-purses in the act of tumbling on to the floor. Yet there was
      nothing finicking about their politeness&mdash;it had the public-school
      touch, and, though sedulous, was virile. More battles than Waterloo have
      been won on our playing-fields, and Margaret bowed to a charm of which she
      did not wholly approve, and said nothing when the Oxford colleges were
      identified wrongly. &ldquo;Male and female created He them&rdquo;; the journey to
      Shrewsbury confirmed this questionable statement, and the long glass
      saloon, that moved so easily and felt so comfortable, became a
      forcing-house for the idea of sex.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Shrewsbury came fresh air. Margaret was all for sight-seeing, and while
      the others were finishing their tea at the Raven, she annexed a motor and
      hurried over the astonishing city. Her chauffeur was not the faithful
      Crane, but an Italian, who dearly loved making her late. Charles, watch in
      hand, though with a level brow, was standing in front of the hotel when
      they returned. It was perfectly all right, he told her; she was by no
      means the last. And then he dived into the coffee-room, and she heard him
      say, &ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, hurry the women up; we shall never be off,&rdquo; and
      Albert Fussell reply, &ldquo;Not I; I&rsquo;ve done my share,&rdquo; and Colonel Fussell
      opine that the ladies were getting themselves up to kill. Presently Myra
      (Mrs. Warrington&rsquo;s daughter) appeared, and as she was his cousin, Charles
      blew her up a little; she had been changing her smart travelling hat for a
      smart motor hat. Then Mrs. Warrington herself, leading the quiet child;
      the two Anglo-Indian ladies were always last. Maids, courier, heavy
      luggage, had already gone on by a branch-line to a station nearer Oniton,
      but there were five hat-boxes and four dressing-bags to be packed, and
      five dust-cloaks to be put on, and to be put off at the last moment,
      because Charles declared them not necessary. The men presided over
      everything with unfailing good-humour. By half-past five the party was
      ready, and went out of Shrewsbury by the Welsh Bridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shropshire had not the reticence of Hertfordshire. Though robbed of half
      its magic by swift movement, it still conveyed the sense of hills. They
      were nearing the buttresses that force the Severn eastward and make it an
      English stream, and the sun, sinking over the Sentinels of Wales, was
      straight in their eyes. Having picked up another guest, they turned
      southward, avoiding the greater mountains, but conscious of an occasional
      summit, rounded and mild, whose colouring differed in quality from that of
      the lower earth, and whose contours altered more slowly. Quiet mysteries
      were in progress behind those tossing horizons: the West, as ever, was
      retreating with some secret which may not be worth the discovery, but
      which no practical man will ever discover.
    </p>
    <p>
      They spoke of Tariff Reform.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Warrington was just back from the Colonies. Like many other critics
      of Empire, her mouth had been stopped with food, and she could only
      exclaim at the hospitality with which she had been received, and warn the
      Mother Country against trifling with young Titans. &ldquo;They threaten to cut
      the painter,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;and where shall we be then? Miss Schlegel,
      you&rsquo;ll undertake to keep Henry sound about Tariff Reform? It is our last
      hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret playfully confessed herself on the other side, and they began to
      quote from their respective handbooks while the motor carried them deep
      into the hills. Curious these were rather than impressive, for their
      outlines lacked beauty, and the pink fields on their summits suggested the
      handkerchiefs of a giant spread out to dry. An occasional outcrop of rock,
      an occasional wood, an occasional &ldquo;forest,&rdquo; treeless and brown, all hinted
      at wildness to follow, but the main colour was an agricultural green. The
      air grew cooler; they had surmounted the last gradient, and Oniton lay
      below them with its church, its radiating houses, its castle, its
      river-girt peninsula. Close to the castle was a grey mansion
      unintellectual but kindly, stretching with its grounds across the
      peninsula&rsquo;s neck&mdash;the sort of mansion that was built all over England
      in the beginning of the last century, while architecture was still an
      expression of the national character. That was the Grange, remarked
      Albert, over his shoulder, and then he jammed the brake on, and the motor
      slowed down and stopped. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; said he, turning round. &ldquo;Do you mind
      getting out&mdash;by the door on the right. Steady on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s happened?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Warrington.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the car behind them drew up, and the voice of Charles was heard
      saying: &ldquo;Get the women out at once.&rdquo; There was a concourse of males, and
      Margaret and her companions were hustled out and received into the second
      car. What had happened? As it started off again, the door of a cottage
      opened, and a girl screamed wildly at them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; the ladies cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charles drove them a hundred yards without speaking. Then he said: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
      all right. Your car just touched a dog.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But stop!&rdquo; cried Margaret, horrified.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It didn&rsquo;t hurt him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t really hurt him?&rdquo; asked Myra.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do PLEASE stop!&rdquo; said Margaret, leaning forward. She was standing up in
      the car, the other occupants holding her knees to steady her. &ldquo;I want to
      go back, please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Charles took no notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve left Mr. Fussell behind,&rdquo; said another; &ldquo;and Angelo, and Crane.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but no woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I expect a little of&rdquo;&mdash;Mrs. Warrington scratched her palm&mdash;&ldquo;will
      be more to the point than one of us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The insurance company see to that,&rdquo; remarked Charles, &ldquo;and Albert will do
      the talking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to go back, though, I say!&rdquo; repeated Margaret, getting angry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charles took no notice. The motor, loaded with refugees, continued to
      travel very slowly down the hill. &ldquo;The men are there,&rdquo; chorused the
      others. &ldquo;They will see to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The men CAN&rsquo;T see to it. Oh, this is ridiculous! Charles, I ask you to
      stop.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stopping&rsquo;s no good,&rdquo; drawled Charles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; said Margaret, and jumped straight out of the car. She fell on
      her knees, cut her gloves, shook her hat over her ear. Cries of alarm
      followed her. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve hurt yourself,&rdquo; exclaimed Charles, jumping after
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I&rsquo;ve hurt myself!&rdquo; she retorted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I ask what&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing to ask,&rdquo; said Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your hand&rsquo;s bleeding.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in for a frightful row from the pater.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should have thought of that sooner, Charles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Charles had never been in such a position before. It was a woman in revolt
      who was hobbling away from him&mdash;and the sight was too strange to
      leave any room for anger. He recovered himself when the others caught them
      up: their sort he understood. He commanded them to go back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albert Fussell was seen walking towards them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right!&rdquo; he called. &ldquo;It was a cat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There!&rdquo; exclaimed Charles triumphantly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only a rotten cat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Got room in your car for a little un? I cut as soon as I saw it wasn&rsquo;t a
      dog; the chauffeurs are tackling the girl.&rdquo; But Margaret walked forward
      steadily. Why should the chauffeurs tackle the girl? Ladies sheltering
      behind men, men sheltering behind servants&mdash;the whole system&rsquo;s wrong,
      and she must challenge it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Schlegel! &rsquo;Pon my word, you&rsquo;ve hurt your hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just going to see,&rdquo; said Margaret. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you wait, Mr. Fussell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The second motor came round the corner. &ldquo;It is all right, madam,&rdquo; said
      Crane in his turn. He had taken to calling her madam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s all right? The cat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, madam. The girl will receive compensation for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was a very ruda girla,&rdquo; said Angelo from the third motor
      thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you have been rude?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Italian spread out his hands, implying that he had not thought of
      rudeness, but would produce it if it pleased her. The situation became
      absurd. The gentlemen were again buzzing round Miss Schlegel with offers
      of assistance, and Lady Edser began to bind up her hand. She yielded,
      apologising slightly, and was led back to the car, and soon the landscape
      resumed its motion, the lonely cottage disappeared, the castle swelled on
      its cushion of turf, and they had arrived. No doubt she had disgraced
      herself. But she felt their whole journey from London had been unreal.
      They had no part with the earth and its emotions. They were dust, and a
      stink, and cosmopolitan chatter, and the girl whose cat had been killed
      had lived more deeply than they.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Henry,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;I have been so naughty,&rdquo; for she had decided
      to take up this line. &ldquo;We ran over a cat. Charles told me not to jump out,
      but I would, and look!&rdquo; She held out her bandaged hand. &ldquo;Your poor Meg
      went such a flop.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wilcox looked bewildered. In evening dress, he was standing to welcome
      his guests in the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thinking it was a dog,&rdquo; added Mrs. Warrington.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, a dog&rsquo;s a companion!&rdquo; said Colonel Fussell. &ldquo;
      A dog&rsquo;ll remember you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you hurt yourself, Margaret?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not to speak about; and it&rsquo;s my left hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, hurry up and change.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She obeyed, as did the others. Mr. Wilcox then turned to his son.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Charles, what&rsquo;s happened?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Charles was absolutely honest. He described what he believed to have
      happened. Albert had flattened out a cat, and Miss Schlegel had lost her
      nerve, as any woman might. She had been got safely into the other car, but
      when it was in motion had leapt out again, in spite of all that they could
      say. After walking a little on the road, she had calmed down and had said
      that she was sorry. His father accepted this explanation, and neither knew
      that Margaret had artfully prepared the way for it. It fitted in too well
      with their view of feminine nature. In the smoking-room, after dinner, the
      Colonel put forward the view that Miss Schlegel had jumped it out of
      devilry. Well he remembered as a young man, in the harbour of Gibraltar
      once, how a girl&mdash;a handsome girl, too&mdash;had jumped overboard for
      a bet. He could see her now, and all the lads overboard after her. But
      Charles and Mr. Wilcox agreed it was much more probably nerves in Miss
      Schlegel&rsquo;s case. Charles was depressed. That woman had a tongue. She would
      bring worse disgrace on his father before she had done with them. He
      strolled out on to the castle mound to think the matter over. The evening
      was exquisite. On three sides of him a little river whispered, full of
      messages from the West; above his head the ruins made patterns against the
      sky. He carefully reviewed their dealings with this family, until he
      fitted Helen, and Margaret, and Aunt Juley into an orderly conspiracy.
      Paternity had made him suspicious. He had two children to look after, and
      more coming, and day by day they seemed less likely to grow up rich men.
      &ldquo;It is all very well,&rdquo; he reflected, &ldquo;the pater&rsquo;s saying that he will be
      just to all, but one can&rsquo;t be just indefinitely. Money isn&rsquo;t elastic.
      What&rsquo;s to happen if Evie has a family? And, come to that, so may the
      pater. There&rsquo;ll not be enough to go round, for there&rsquo;s none coming in,
      either through Dolly or Percy. It&rsquo;s damnable!&rdquo; He looked enviously at the
      Grange, whose windows poured light and laughter. First and last, this
      wedding would cost a pretty penny. Two ladies were strolling up and down
      the garden terrace, and as the syllables &ldquo;Imperialism&rdquo; were wafted to his
      ears, he guessed that one of them was his aunt. She might have helped him,
      if she too had not had a family to provide for. &ldquo;Every one for himself,&rdquo;
       he repeated&mdash;a maxim which had cheered him in the past, but which
      rang grimly enough among the ruins of Oniton. He lacked his father&rsquo;s
      ability in business, and so had an ever higher regard for money; unless he
      could inherit plenty, he feared to leave his children poor.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he sat thinking, one of the ladies left the terrace and walked into the
      meadow; he recognised her as Margaret by the white bandage that gleamed on
      her arm, and put out his cigar, lest the gleam should betray him. She
      climbed up the mound in zigzags, and at times stooped down, as if she was
      stroking the turf. It sounds absolutely incredible, but for a moment
      Charles thought that she was in love with him, and had come out to tempt
      him. Charles believed in temptresses, who are indeed the strong man&rsquo;s
      necessary complement, and having no sense of humour, he could not purge
      himself of the thought by a smile. Margaret, who was engaged to his
      father, and his sister&rsquo;s wedding-guest, kept on her way without noticing
      him, and he admitted that he had wronged her on this point. But what was
      she doing? Why was she stumbling about amongst the rubble and catching her
      dress in brambles and burrs? As she edged round the keep, she must have
      got to windward and smelt his cigar-smoke, for she exclaimed, &ldquo;Hullo!
      Who&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Charles made no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Saxon or Celt?&rdquo; she continued, laughing in the darkness. &ldquo;But it doesn&rsquo;t
      matter. Whichever you are, you will have to listen to me. I love this
      place. I love Shropshire. I hate London. I am glad that this will be my
      home. Ah, dear&rdquo;&mdash;she was now moving back towards the house&mdash;&ldquo;what
      a comfort to have arrived!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That woman means mischief,&rdquo; thought Charles, and compressed his lips. In
      a few minutes he followed her indoors, as the ground was getting damp.
      Mists were rising from the river, and presently it became invisible,
      though it whispered more loudly. There had been a heavy downpour in the
      Welsh hills.

      CHAPTER XXVI
    </h2>
    <p>
      Next morning a fine mist covered the peninsula. The weather promised well,
      and the outline of the castle mound grew clearer each moment that Margaret
      watched it. Presently she saw the keep, and the sun painted the rubble
      gold, and charged the white sky with blue. The shadow of the house
      gathered itself together, and fell over the garden. A cat looked up at her
      window and mewed. Lastly the river appeared, still holding the mists
      between its banks and its overhanging alders, and only visible as far as a
      hill, which cut off its upper reaches.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret was fascinated by Oniton. She had said that she loved it, but it
      was rather its romantic tension that held her. The rounded Druids of whom
      she had caught glimpses in her drive, the rivers hurrying down from them
      to England, the carelessly modelled masses of the lower hills, thrilled
      her with poetry. The house was insignificant, but the prospect from it
      would be an eternal joy, and she thought of all the friends she would have
      to stop in it, and of the conversion of Henry himself to a rural life.
      Society, too, promised favourably. The rector of the parish had dined with
      them last night, and she found that he was a friend of her father&rsquo;s, and
      so knew what to find in her. She liked him. He would introduce her to the
      town. While, on her other side, Sir James Bidder sat, repeating that she
      only had to give the word, and he would whip up the county families for
      twenty miles round. Whether Sir James, who was Garden Seeds, had promised
      what he could perform, she doubted, but so long as Henry mistook them for
      the county families when they did call, she was content.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charles Wilcox and Albert Fussell now crossed the lawn. They were going
      for a morning dip, and a servant followed them with their bathing-suits.
      She had meant to take a stroll herself before breakfast, but saw that the
      day was still sacred to men, and amused herself by watching their
      contretemps. In the first place the key of the bathing-shed could not be
      found. Charles stood by the riverside with folded hands, tragical, while
      the servant shouted, and was misunderstood by another servant in the
      garden. Then came a difficulty about a springboard, and soon three people
      were running backwards and forwards over the meadow, with orders and
      counter orders and recriminations and apologies. If Margaret wanted to
      jump from a motor-car, she jumped; if Tibby thought paddling would benefit
      his ankles, he paddled; if a clerk desired adventure, he took a walk in
      the dark. But these athletes seemed paralysed. They could not bathe
      without their appliances, though the morning sun was calling and the last
      mists were rising from the dimpling stream. Had they found the life of the
      body after all? Could not the men whom they despised as milksops beat
      them, even on their own ground?
    </p>
    <p>
      She thought of the bathing arrangements as they should be in her day&mdash;no
      worrying of servants, no appliances, beyond good sense. Her reflections
      were disturbed by the quiet child, who had come out to speak to the cat,
      but was now watching her watch the men. She called, &ldquo;Good-morning, dear,&rdquo;
       a little sharply. Her voice spread consternation. Charles looked round,
      and though completely attired in indigo blue, vanished into the shed, and
      was seen no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Wilcox is up&mdash;&rdquo; the child whispered, and then became
      unintelligible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; it sounded like, &ldquo;&mdash;cut-yoke&mdash;sack-back&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t hear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;On the bed&mdash;tissue-paper&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gathering that the wedding-dress was on view, and that a visit would be
      seemly, she went to Evie&rsquo;s room. All was hilarity here. Evie, in a
      petticoat, was dancing with one of the Anglo-Indian ladies, while the
      other was adoring yards of white satin. They screamed, they laughed, they
      sang, and the dog barked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret screamed a little too, but without conviction. She could not feel
      that a wedding was so funny. Perhaps something was missing in her
      equipment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Evie gasped: &ldquo;Dolly is a rotter not to be here! Oh, we would rag just
      then!&rdquo; Then Margaret went down to breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry was already installed; he ate slowly and spoke little, and was, in
      Margaret&rsquo;s eyes, the only member of their party who dodged emotion
      successfully. She could not suppose him indifferent either to the loss of
      his daughter or to the presence of his future wife. Yet he dwelt intact,
      only issuing orders occasionally&mdash;orders that promoted the comfort of
      his guests. He inquired after her hand; he set her to pour out the coffee
      and Mrs. Warrington to pour out the tea. When Evie came down there was a
      moment&rsquo;s awkwardness, and both ladies rose to vacate their places.
      &ldquo;Burton,&rdquo; called Henry, &ldquo;serve tea and coffee from the sideboard!&rdquo; It
      wasn&rsquo;t genuine tact, but it was tact, of a sort&mdash;the sort that is as
      useful as the genuine, and saves even more situations at Board meetings.
      Henry treated a marriage like a funeral, item by item, never raising his
      eyes to the whole, and &ldquo;Death, where is thy sting? Love, where is thy
      victory?&rdquo; one would exclaim at the close.
    </p>
    <p>
      After breakfast Margaret claimed a few words with him. It was always best
      to approach him formally. She asked for the interview, because he was
      going on to shoot grouse to-morrow, and she was returning to Helen in
      town.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, dear,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Of course, I have the time. What do you
      want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was afraid something had gone wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I have nothing to say, but you may talk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glancing at his watch, he talked of the nasty curve at the lych-gate. She
      heard him with interest. Her surface could always respond to his without
      contempt, though all her deeper being might be yearning to help him. She
      had abandoned any plan of action. Love is the best, and the more she let
      herself love him, the more chance was there that he would set his soul in
      order. Such a moment as this, when they sat under fair weather by the
      walks of their future home, was so sweet to her that its sweetness would
      surely pierce to him. Each lift of his eyes, each parting of the thatched
      lip from the clean-shaven, must prelude the tenderness that kills the Monk
      and the Beast at a single blow. Disappointed a hundred times, she still
      hoped. She loved him with too clear a vision to fear his cloudiness.
      Whether he droned trivialities, as to-day, or sprang kisses on her in the
      twilight, she could pardon him, she could respond.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If there is this nasty curve,&rdquo; she suggested, &ldquo;couldn&rsquo;t we walk to the
      church? Not, of course, you and Evie; but the rest of us might very well
      go on first, and that would mean fewer carriages.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One can&rsquo;t have ladies walking through the Market Square. The Fussells
      wouldn&rsquo;t like it; they were awfully particular at Charles&rsquo;s wedding. My&mdash;she&mdash;our
      party was anxious to walk, and certainly the church was just round the
      corner, and I shouldn&rsquo;t have minded; but the Colonel made a great point of
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You men shouldn&rsquo;t be so chivalrous,&rdquo; said Margaret thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She knew why not, but said that she did not know. He then announced that,
      unless she had anything special to say, he must visit the wine-cellar, and
      they went off together in search of Burton. Though clumsy and a little
      inconvenient, Oniton was a genuine country-house. They clattered down
      flagged passages, looking into room after room, and scaring unknown maids
      from the performance of obscure duties. The wedding-breakfast must be in
      readiness when they come back from church, and tea would be served in the
      garden. The sight of so many agitated and serious people made Margaret
      smile, but she reflected that they were paid to be serious, and enjoyed
      being agitated. Here were the lower wheels of the machine that was tossing
      Evie up into nuptial glory. A little boy blocked their way with pig-pails.
      His mind could not grasp their greatness, and he said: &ldquo;By your leave; let
      me pass, please.&rdquo; Henry asked him where Burton was. But the servants were
      so new that they did not know one another&rsquo;s names. In the still-room sat
      the band, who had stipulated for champagne as part of their fee, and who
      were already drinking beer. Scents of Araby came from the kitchen, mingled
      with cries. Margaret knew what had happened there, for it happened at
      Wickham Place. One of the wedding dishes had boiled over, and the cook was
      throwing cedar-shavings to hide the smell. At last they came upon the
      butler. Henry gave him the keys, and handed Margaret down the
      cellar-stairs. Two doors were unlocked. She, who kept all her wine at the
      bottom of the linen-cupboard, was astonished at the sight. &ldquo;We shall never
      get through it!&rdquo; she cried, and the two men were suddenly drawn into
      brotherhood, and exchanged smiles. She felt as if she had again jumped out
      of the car while it was moving.
    </p>
    <p>
      Certainly Oniton would take some digesting. It would be no small business
      to remain herself, and yet to assimilate such an establishment. She must
      remain herself, for his sake as well as her own, since a shadowy wife
      degrades the husband whom she accompanies; and she must assimilate for
      reasons of common honesty, since she had no right to marry a man and make
      him uncomfortable. Her only ally was the power of Home. The loss of
      Wickham Place had taught her more than its possession. Howards End had
      repeated the lesson. She was determined to create new sanctities among
      these hills.
    </p>
    <p>
      After visiting the wine-cellar, she dressed, and then came the wedding,
      which seemed a small affair when compared with the preparations for it.
      Everything went like one o&rsquo;clock. Mr. Cahill materialised out of space,
      and was waiting for his bride at the church door. No one dropped the ring
      or mispronounced the responses, or trod on Evie&rsquo;s train, or cried. In a
      few minutes the clergymen performed their duty, the register was signed,
      and they were back in their carriages, negotiating the dangerous curve by
      the lych-gate. Margaret was convinced that they had not been married at
      all, and that the Norman church had been intent all the time on other
      business.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were more documents to sign at the house, and the breakfast to eat,
      and then a few more people dropped in for the garden party. There had been
      a great many refusals, and after all it was not a very big affair&mdash;not
      as big as Margaret&rsquo;s would be. She noted the dishes and the strips of red
      carpet, that outwardly she might give Henry what was proper. But inwardly
      she hoped for something better than this blend of Sunday church and
      fox-hunting. If only some one had been upset! But this wedding had gone
      off so particularly well&mdash;&ldquo;quite like a durbar&rdquo; in the opinion of
      Lady Edser, and she thoroughly agreed with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the wasted day lumbered forward, the bride and bridegroom drove off,
      yelling with laughter, and for the second time the sun retreated towards
      the hills of Wales. Henry, who was more tired than he owned, came up to
      her in the castle meadow, and, in tones of unusual softness, said that he
      was pleased. Everything had gone off so well. She felt that he was
      praising her, too, and blushed; certainly she had done all she could with
      his intractable friends, and had made a special point of kotowing to the
      men. They were breaking camp this evening; only the Warringtons and quiet
      child would stay the night, and the others were already moving towards the
      house to finish their packing. &ldquo;I think it did go off well,&rdquo; she agreed.
      &ldquo;Since I had to jump out of the motor, I&rsquo;m thankful I lighted on my left
      hand. I am so very glad about it, Henry dear; I only hope that the guests
      at ours may be half as comfortable. You must all remember that we have no
      practical person among us, except my aunt, and she is not used to
      entertainments on a large scale.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; he said gravely. &ldquo;Under the circumstances, it would be better to
      put everything into the hands of Harrods or Whiteley&rsquo;s, or even to go to
      some hotel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You desire a hotel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, because&mdash;well, I mustn&rsquo;t interfere with you. No doubt you want
      to be married from your old home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My old home&rsquo;s falling into pieces, Henry. I only want my new. Isn&rsquo;t it a
      perfect evening&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Alexandrina isn&rsquo;t bad&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Alexandrina,&rdquo; she echoed, more occupied with the threads of smoke
      that were issuing from their chimneys, and ruling the sunlit slopes with
      parallels of grey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s off Curzon Street.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it? Let&rsquo;s be married from off Curzon Street.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then she turned westward, to gaze at the swirling gold. Just where the
      river rounded the hill the sun caught it. Fairyland must lie above the
      bend, and its precious liquid was pouring towards them past Charles&rsquo;s
      bathing-shed. She gazed so long that her eyes were dazzled, and when they
      moved back to the house, she could not recognise the faces of people who
      were coming out of it. A parlour-maid was preceding them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are those people?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re callers!&rdquo; exclaimed Henry. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too late for callers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps they&rsquo;re town people who want to see the wedding presents.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not at home yet to townees.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, hide among the ruins, and if I can stop them, I will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He thanked her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret went forward, smiling socially. She supposed that these were
      unpunctual guests, who would have to be content with vicarious civility,
      since Evie and Charles were gone, Henry tired, and the others in their
      rooms. She assumed the airs of a hostess; not for long. For one of the
      group was Helen&mdash;Helen in her oldest clothes, and dominated by that
      tense, wounding excitement that had made her a terror in their nursery
      days.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; she called. &ldquo;Oh, what&rsquo;s wrong? Is Tibby ill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen spoke to her two companions, who fell back. Then she bore forward
      furiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re starving!&rdquo; she shouted. &ldquo;I found them starving!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who? Why have you come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Basts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Helen!&rdquo; moaned Margaret. &ldquo;Whatever have you done now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has lost his place. He has been turned out of his bank. Yes, he&rsquo;s done
      for. We upper classes have ruined him, and I suppose you&rsquo;ll tell me it&rsquo;s
      the battle of life. Starving. His wife is ill. Starving. She fainted in
      the train.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Helen, are you mad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps. Yes. If you like, I&rsquo;m mad. But I&rsquo;ve brought them. I&rsquo;ll stand
      injustice no longer. I&rsquo;ll show up the wretchedness that lies under this
      luxury, this talk of impersonal forces, this cant about God doing what
      we&rsquo;re too slack to do ourselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you actually brought two starving people from London to Shropshire,
      Helen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen was checked. She had not thought of this, and her hysteria abated.
      &ldquo;There was a restaurant car on the train,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be absurd. They aren&rsquo;t starving, and you know it. Now, begin from
      the beginning. I won&rsquo;t have such theatrical nonsense. How dare you! Yes,
      how dare you!&rdquo; she repeated, as anger filled her, &ldquo;bursting in to Evie&rsquo;s
      wedding in this heartless way. My goodness! but you&rsquo;ve a perverted notion
      of philanthropy. Look&rdquo;&mdash;she indicated the house&mdash;&ldquo;servants,
      people out of the windows. They think it&rsquo;s some vulgar scandal, and I must
      explain, &lsquo;Oh no, it&rsquo;s only my sister screaming, and only two hangers-on of
      ours, whom she has brought here for no conceivable reason.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kindly take back that word &lsquo;hangers-on,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Helen, ominously calm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; conceded Margaret, who for all her wrath was determined to
      avoid a real quarrel. &ldquo;I, too, am sorry about them, but it beats me why
      you&rsquo;ve brought them here, or why you&rsquo;re here yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s our last chance of seeing Mr. Wilcox.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret moved towards the house at this. She was determined not to worry
      Henry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s going to Scotland. I know he is. I insist on seeing him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew it was our last chance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do, Mr. Bast?&rdquo; said Margaret, trying to control her voice.
      &ldquo;This is an odd business. What view do you take of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is Mrs. Bast, too,&rdquo; prompted Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jacky also shook hands. She, like her husband, was shy, and, furthermore,
      ill, and furthermore, so bestially stupid that she could not grasp what
      was happening. She only knew that the lady had swept down like a whirlwind
      last night, had paid the rent, redeemed the furniture, provided them with
      a dinner and a breakfast, and ordered them to meet her at Paddington next
      morning. Leonard had feebly protested, and when the morning came, had
      suggested that they shouldn&rsquo;t go. But she, half mesmerised, had obeyed.
      The lady had told them to, and they must, and their bed-sitting-room had
      accordingly changed into Paddington, and Paddington into a railway
      carriage, that shook, and grew hot, and grew cold, and vanished entirely,
      and reappeared amid torrents of expensive scent. &ldquo;You have fainted,&rdquo; said
      the lady in an awe-struck voice. &ldquo;Perhaps the air will do you good.&rdquo; And
      perhaps it had, for here she was, feeling rather better among a lot of
      flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t want to intrude,&rdquo; began Leonard, in answer to Margaret&rsquo;s
      question. &ldquo;But you have been so kind to me in the past in warning me about
      the Porphyrion that I wondered&mdash;why, I wondered whether&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whether we could get him back into the Porphyrion again,&rdquo; supplied Helen.
      &ldquo;Meg, this has been a cheerful business. A bright evening&rsquo;s work that was
      on Chelsea Embankment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret shook her head and returned to Mr. Bast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand. You left the Porphyrion because we suggested it was a
      bad concern, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And went into a bank instead?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you all that,&rdquo; said Helen; &ldquo;and they reduced their staff after he
      had been in a month, and now he&rsquo;s penniless, and I consider that we and
      our informant are directly to blame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hate all this,&rdquo; Leonard muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you do, Mr. Bast. But it&rsquo;s no good mincing matters. You have done
      yourself no good by coming here. If you intend to confront Mr. Wilcox, and
      to call him to account for a chance remark, you will make a very great
      mistake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I brought them. I did it all,&rdquo; cried Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can only advise you to go at once. My sister has put you in a false
      position, and it is kindest to tell you so. It&rsquo;s too late to get to town,
      but you&rsquo;ll find a comfortable hotel in Oniton, where Mrs. Bast can rest,
      and I hope you&rsquo;ll be my guests there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t what I want, Miss Schlegel,&rdquo; said Leonard. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re very kind,
      and no doubt it&rsquo;s a false position, but you make me miserable. I seem no
      good at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s work he wants,&rdquo; interpreted Helen. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you see?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he said: &ldquo;Jacky, let&rsquo;s go. We&rsquo;re more bother than we&rsquo;re worth. We&rsquo;re
      costing these ladies pounds and pounds already to get work for us, and
      they never will. There&rsquo;s nothing we&rsquo;re good enough to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We would like to find you work,&rdquo; said Margaret rather conventionally. &ldquo;We
      want to&mdash;I, like my sister. You&rsquo;re only down in your luck. Go to the
      hotel, have a good night&rsquo;s rest, and some day you shall pay me back the
      bill, if you prefer it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Leonard was near the abyss, and at such moments men see clearly. &ldquo;You
      don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking about,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I shall never get work
      now. If rich people fail at one profession, they can try another. Not I. I
      had my groove, and I&rsquo;ve got out of it. I could do one particular branch of
      insurance in one particular office well enough to command a salary, but
      that&rsquo;s all. Poetry&rsquo;s nothing, Miss Schlegel. One&rsquo;s thoughts about this and
      that are nothing. Your money, too, is nothing, if you&rsquo;ll understand me. I
      mean if a man over twenty once loses his own particular job, it&rsquo;s all over
      with him. I have seen it happen to others. Their friends gave them money
      for a little, but in the end they fall over the edge. It&rsquo;s no good. It&rsquo;s
      the whole world pulling. There always will be rich and poor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He ceased. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you have something to eat?&rdquo; said Margaret. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know
      what to do. It isn&rsquo;t my house, and though Mr. Wilcox would have been glad
      to see you at any other time&mdash;as I say, I don&rsquo;t know what to do, but
      I undertake to do what I can for you. Helen, offer them something. Do try
      a sandwich, Mrs. Bast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They moved to a long table behind which a servant was still standing. Iced
      cakes, sandwiches innumerable, coffee, claret-cup, champagne, remained
      almost intact; their overfed guests could do no more. Leonard refused.
      Jacky thought she could manage a little. Margaret left them whispering
      together, and had a few more words with Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      She said: &ldquo;Helen, I like Mr. Bast. I agree that he&rsquo;s worth helping. I
      agree that we are directly responsible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indirectly. Via Mr. Wilcox.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me tell you once for all that if you take up that attitude, I&rsquo;ll do
      nothing. No doubt you&rsquo;re right logically, and are entitled to say a great
      many scathing things about Henry. Only, I won&rsquo;t have it. So choose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen looked at the sunset.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you promise to take them quietly to the George I will speak to Henry
      about them&mdash;in my own way, mind; there is to be none of this absurd
      screaming about justice. I have no use for justice. If it was only a
      question of money, we could do it ourselves. But he wants work, and that
      we can&rsquo;t give him, but possibly Henry can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s his duty to,&rdquo; grumbled Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor am I concerned with duty. I&rsquo;m concerned with the characters of
      various people whom we know, and how, things being as they are, things may
      be made a little better. Mr. Wilcox hates being asked favours; all
      business men do. But I am going to ask him, at the risk of a rebuff,
      because I want to make things a little better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. I promise. You take it very calmly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take them off to the George, then, and I&rsquo;ll try. Poor creatures! but they
      look tired.&rdquo; As they parted, she added: &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t nearly done with you,
      though, Helen. You have been most self-indulgent. I can&rsquo;t get over it. You
      have less restraint rather than more as you grow older. Think it over and
      alter yourself, or we shan&rsquo;t have happy lives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She rejoined Henry. Fortunately he had been sitting down: these physical
      matters were important. &ldquo;Was it townees?&rdquo; he asked, greeting her with a
      pleasant smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never believe me,&rdquo; said Margaret, sitting down beside him. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
      all right now, but it was my sister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Helen here?&rdquo; he cried, preparing to rise. &ldquo;But she refused the
      invitation. I thought hated weddings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get up. She has not come to the wedding. I&rsquo;ve bundled her off to
      the George.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Inherently hospitable, he protested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; she has two of her proteges with her and must keep with them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let &rsquo;em all come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Henry, did you see them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did catch sight of a brown bunch of a woman, certainly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The brown bunch was Helen, but did you catch sight of a sea-green and
      salmon bunch?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! are they out bean-feasting?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; business. They wanted to see me, and later on I want to talk to you
      about them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was ashamed of her own diplomacy. In dealing with a Wilcox, how
      tempting it was to lapse from comradeship, and to give him the kind of
      woman that he desired! Henry took the hint at once, and said: &ldquo;Why later
      on? Tell me now. No time like the present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it isn&rsquo;t a long story.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, not five minutes; but there&rsquo;s a sting at the end of it, for I want
      you to find the man some work in your office.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are his qualifications?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. He&rsquo;s a clerk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How old?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twenty-five, perhaps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s his name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bast,&rdquo; said Margaret, and was about to remind him that they had met at
      Wickham Place, but stopped herself. It had not been a successful meeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where was he before?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dempster&rsquo;s Bank.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did he leave?&rdquo; he asked, still remembering nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They reduced their staff.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right; I&rsquo;ll see him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the reward of her tact and devotion through the day. Now she
      understood why some women prefer influence to rights. Mrs. Plynlimmon,
      when condemning suffragettes, had said: &ldquo;The woman who can&rsquo;t influence her
      husband to vote the way she wants ought to be ashamed of herself.&rdquo;
       Margaret had winced, but she was influencing Henry now, and though pleased
      at her little victory, she knew that she had won it by the methods of the
      harem.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should be glad if you took him,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t know whether
      he&rsquo;s qualified.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do what I can. But, Margaret, this mustn&rsquo;t be taken as a precedent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, of course&mdash;of course&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t fit in your proteges every day. Business would suffer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can promise you he&rsquo;s the last. He&mdash;he&rsquo;s rather a special case.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Proteges always are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She let it stand at that. He rose with a little extra touch of
      complacency, and held out his hand to help her up. How wide the gulf
      between Henry as he was and Henry as Helen thought he ought to be! And she
      herself&mdash;hovering as usual between the two, now accepting men as they
      are, now yearning with her sister for Truth. Love and Truth&mdash;their
      warfare seems eternal. Perhaps the whole visible world rests on it, and if
      they were one, life itself, like the spirits when Prospero was reconciled
      to his brother, might vanish into air, into thin air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your protege has made us late,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;The Fussells&mdash;will just be
      starting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the whole she sided with men as they are. Henry would save the Basts as
      he had saved Howards End, while Helen and her friends were discussing the
      ethics of salvation. His was a slap-dash method, but the world has been
      built slap-dash, and the beauty of mountain and river and sunset may be
      but the varnish with which the unskilled artificer hides his joins.
      Oniton, like herself, was imperfect. Its apple-trees were stunted, its
      castle ruinous. It, too, had suffered in the border warfare between the
      Anglo-Saxon and the Celt, between things as they are and as they ought to
      be. Once more the west was retreating, once again the orderly stars were
      dotting the eastern sky. There is certainly no rest for us on the earth.
      But there is happiness, and as Margaret descended the mound on her lover&rsquo;s
      arm, she felt that she was having her share.
    </p>
    <p>
      To her annoyance, Mrs. Bast was still in the garden; the husband and Helen
      had left her there to finish her meal while they went to engage rooms.
      Margaret found this woman repellent. She had felt, when shaking her hand,
      an overpowering shame. She remembered the motive of her call at Wickham
      Place, and smelt again odours from the abyss&mdash;odours the more
      disturbing because they were involuntary. For there was no malice in
      Jacky. There she sat, a piece of cake in one hand, an empty champagne
      glass in the other, doing no harm to anybody.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s overtired,&rdquo; Margaret whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s something else,&rdquo; said Henry. &ldquo;This won&rsquo;t do. I can&rsquo;t have her in my
      garden in this state.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she&mdash;&rdquo; Margaret hesitated to add &ldquo;drunk.&rdquo; Now that she was going
      to marry him, he had grown particular. He discountenanced risque
      conversations now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry went up to the woman. She raised her face, which gleamed in the
      twilight like a puff-ball.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam, you will be more comfortable at the hotel,&rdquo; he said sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jacky replied: &ldquo;If it isn&rsquo;t Hen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ne crois pas que le mari lui ressemble,&rdquo; apologised Margaret. &ldquo;Il est
      tout à fait différent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Henry!&rdquo; she repeated, quite distinctly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wilcox was much annoyed. &ldquo;I congratulate you on your proteges,&rdquo; he
      remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hen, don&rsquo;t go. You do love me, dear, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless us, what a person!&rdquo; sighed Margaret, gathering up her skirts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jacky pointed with her cake. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a nice boy, you are.&rdquo; She yawned.
      &ldquo;There now, I love you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Henry, I am awfully sorry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And pray why?&rdquo; he asked, and looked at her so sternly that she feared he
      was ill. He seemed more scandalised than the facts demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To have brought this down on you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray don&rsquo;t apologise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The voice continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why does she call you &lsquo;Hen&rsquo;?&rdquo; said Margaret innocently. &ldquo;Has she ever
      seen you before?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seen Hen before!&rdquo; said Jacky. &ldquo;Who hasn&rsquo;t seen Hen? He&rsquo;s serving you like
      me, my boys! You wait&mdash;Still we love &rsquo;em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you now satisfied?&rdquo; Henry asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret began to grow frightened. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what it is all about,&rdquo;
       she said. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s come in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he thought she was acting. He thought he was trapped. He saw his whole
      life crumbling. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you indeed?&rdquo; he said bitingly. &ldquo;I do. Allow me to
      congratulate you on the success of your plan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is Helen&rsquo;s plan, not mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I now understand your interest in the Basts. Very well thought out. I am
      amused at your caution, Margaret. You are quite right&mdash;it was
      necessary. I am a man, and have lived a man&rsquo;s past. I have the honour to
      release you from your engagement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still she could not understand. She knew of life&rsquo;s seamy side as a theory;
      she could not grasp it as a fact. More words from Jacky were necessary&mdash;words
      unequivocal, undenied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that&mdash;&rdquo; burst from her, and she went indoors. She stopped herself
      from saying more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So what?&rdquo; asked Colonel Fussell, who was getting ready to start in the
      hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were saying&mdash;Henry and I were just having the fiercest argument,
      my point being&mdash;&rdquo; Seizing his fur coat from a footman, she offered to
      help him on. He protested, and there was a playful little scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, let me do that,&rdquo; said Henry, following.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks so much! You see&mdash;he has forgiven me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel said gallantly: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t expect there&rsquo;s much to forgive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He got into the car. The ladies followed him after an interval. Maids,
      courier, and heavier luggage had been sent on earlier by the branch-line.
      Still chattering, still thanking their host and patronising their future
      hostess, the guests were borne away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Margaret continued: &ldquo;So that woman has been your mistress?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You put it with your usual delicacy,&rdquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When, please?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When, please?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ten years ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She left him without a word. For it was not her tragedy; it was Mrs.
      Wilcox&rsquo;s.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Helen began to wonder why she had spent a matter of eight pounds in making
      some people ill and others angry. Now that the wave of excitement was
      ebbing, and had left her, Mr. Bast, and Mrs. Bast stranded for the night
      in a Shropshire hotel, she asked herself what forces had made the wave
      flow. At all events, no harm was done. Margaret would play the game
      properly now, and though Helen disapproved of her sister&rsquo;s methods, she
      knew that the Basts would benefit by them in the long-run.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Wilcox is so illogical,&rdquo; she explained to Leonard, who had put his
      wife to bed, and was sitting with her in the empty coffee-room. &ldquo;If we
      told him it was his duty to take you on, he might refuse to do it. The
      fact is, he isn&rsquo;t properly educated. I don&rsquo;t want to set you against him,
      but you&rsquo;ll find him a trial.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can never thank you sufficiently, Miss Schlegel,&rdquo; was all that Leonard
      felt equal to.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe in personal responsibility. Don&rsquo;t you? And in personal
      everything. I hate&mdash;I suppose I oughtn&rsquo;t to say that&mdash;but the
      Wilcoxes are on the wrong tack surely. Or perhaps it isn&rsquo;t their fault.
      Perhaps the little thing that says &lsquo;I&rsquo; is missing out of the middle of
      their heads, and then it&rsquo;s a waste of time to blame them. There&rsquo;s a
      nightmare of a theory that says a special race is being born which will
      rule the rest of us in the future just because it lacks the little thing
      that says &lsquo;I.&rsquo; Had you heard that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I get no time for reading.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had you thought it, then? That there are two kinds of people&mdash;our
      kind, who live straight from the middle of their heads, and the other kind
      who can&rsquo;t, because their heads have no middle? They can&rsquo;t say &lsquo;I.&rsquo; They
      AREN&rsquo;T in fact, and so they&rsquo;re supermen. Pierpont Morgan has never said
      &lsquo;I&rsquo; in his life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Leonard roused himself. If his benefactress wanted intellectual
      conversation, she must have it. She was more important than his ruined
      past. &ldquo;I never got on to Nietzsche,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But I always understood
      that those supermen were rather what you may call egoists.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no, that&rsquo;s wrong,&rdquo; replied Helen. &ldquo;No superman ever said &lsquo;I want,&rsquo; 
      because &lsquo;I want&rsquo; must lead to the question, &lsquo;Who am I?&rsquo; and so to Pity and
      to Justice. He only says &lsquo;want.&rsquo; &lsquo;Want Europe,&rsquo; if he&rsquo;s Napoleon; &lsquo;want
      wives,&rsquo; if he&rsquo;s Bluebeard; &lsquo;want Botticelli,&rsquo; if he&rsquo;s Pierpont Morgan.
      Never the &lsquo;I&rsquo;; and if you could pierce through the superman, you&rsquo;d find
      panic and emptiness in the middle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Leonard was silent for a moment. Then he said: &ldquo;May I take it, Miss
      Schlegel, that you and I are both the sort that say &lsquo;I&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And your sister, too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; repeated Helen, a little sharply. She was annoyed with
      Margaret, but did not want her discussed. &ldquo;All presentable people say
      &lsquo;I.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Mr. Wilcox&mdash;he is not perhaps&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that it&rsquo;s any good discussing Mr. Wilcox either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so, quite so,&rdquo; he agreed. Helen asked herself why she had snubbed
      him. Once or twice during the day she had encouraged him to criticise, and
      then had pulled him up short. Was she afraid of him presuming? If so, it
      was disgusting of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he was thinking the snub quite natural. Everything she did was
      natural, and incapable of causing offence. While the Miss Schlegels were
      together he had felt them scarcely human&mdash;a sort of admonitory
      whirligig. But a Miss Schlegel alone was different. She was in Helen&rsquo;s
      case unmarried, in Margaret&rsquo;s about to be married, in neither case an echo
      of her sister. A light had fallen at last into this rich upper world, and
      he saw that it was full of men and women, some of whom were more friendly
      to him than others. Helen had become &ldquo;his&rdquo; Miss Schlegel, who scolded him
      and corresponded with him, and had swept down yesterday with grateful
      vehemence. Margaret, though not unkind, was severe and remote. He would
      not presume to help her, for instance. He had never liked her, and began
      to think that his original impression was true, and that her sister did
      not like her either. Helen was certainly lonely. She, who gave away so
      much, was receiving too little. Leonard was pleased to think that he could
      spare her vexation by holding his tongue and concealing what he knew about
      Mr. Wilcox. Jacky had announced her discovery when he fetched her from the
      lawn. After the first shock, he did not mind for himself. By now he had no
      illusions about his wife, and this was only one new stain on the face of a
      love that had never been pure. To keep perfection perfect, that should be
      his ideal, if the future gave him time to have ideals. Helen, and Margaret
      for Helen&rsquo;s sake, must not know.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen disconcerted him by turning the conversation to his wife. &ldquo;Mrs. Bast&mdash;does
      she ever say &lsquo;I&rsquo;?&rdquo; she asked, half mischievously, and then, &ldquo;Is she very
      tired?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s better she stops in her room,&rdquo; said Leonard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I sit up with her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thank you; she does not need company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Bast, what kind of woman is your wife?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Leonard blushed up to his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ought to know my ways by now. Does that question offend you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, oh no, Miss Schlegel, no.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I love honesty. Don&rsquo;t pretend your marriage has been a happy one.
      You and she can have nothing in common.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not deny it, but said shyly: &ldquo;I suppose that&rsquo;s pretty obvious; but
      Jacky never meant to do anybody any harm. When things went wrong, or I
      heard things, I used to think it was her fault, but, looking back, it&rsquo;s
      more mine. I needn&rsquo;t have married her, but as I have I must stick to her
      and keep her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long have you been married?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nearly three years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did your people say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They will not have anything to do with us. They had a sort of family
      council when they heard I was married, and cut us off altogether.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen began to pace up and down the room. &ldquo;My good boy, what a mess!&rdquo; she
      said gently. &ldquo;Who are your people?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He could answer this. His parents, who were dead, had been in trade; his
      sisters had married commercial travellers; his brother was a lay-reader.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And your grandparents?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Leonard told her a secret that he had held shameful up to now. &ldquo;They were
      just nothing at all,&rdquo; he said &ldquo;agricultural labourers and that sort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So! From which part?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lincolnshire mostly, but my mother&rsquo;s father&mdash;he, oddly enough, came
      from these parts round here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From this very Shropshire. Yes, that is odd. My mother&rsquo;s people were
      Lancashire. But why do your brother and your sisters object to Mrs. Bast?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me, you do know. I am not a baby. I can bear anything you tell me,
      and the more you tell the more I shall be able to help. Have they heard
      anything against her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I have guessed now,&rdquo; said Helen very gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so, Miss Schlegel; I hope not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must be honest, even over these things. I have guessed. I am
      frightfully, dreadfully sorry, but it does not make the least difference
      to me. I shall feel just the same to both of you. I blame, not your wife
      for these things, but men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Leonard left it at that&mdash;so long as she did not guess the man. She
      stood at the window and slowly pulled up the blinds. The hotel looked over
      a dark square. The mists had begun. When she turned back to him her eyes
      were shining. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you worry,&rdquo; he pleaded. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t bear that. We shall
      be all right if I get work. If I could only get work&mdash;something
      regular to do. Then it wouldn&rsquo;t be so bad again. I don&rsquo;t trouble after
      books as I used. I can imagine that with regular work we should settle
      down again. It stops one thinking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Settle down to what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, just settle down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that&rsquo;s to be life!&rdquo; said Helen, with a catch in her throat. &ldquo;How can
      you, with all the beautiful things to see and do&mdash;with music&mdash;with
      walking at night&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Walking is well enough when a man&rsquo;s in work,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Oh, I did
      talk a lot of nonsense once, but there&rsquo;s nothing like a bailiff in the
      house to drive it out of you. When I saw him fingering my Ruskins and
      Stevensons, I seemed to see life straight and real, and it isn&rsquo;t a pretty
      sight. My books are back again, thanks to you, but they&rsquo;ll never be the
      same to me again, and I shan&rsquo;t ever again think night in the woods is
      wonderful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; asked Helen, throwing up the window.
    </p>
    <p>
    &ldquo;Because I see one must
      have money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I was wrong, but&mdash;the clergyman&mdash;he has money of his
      own, or else he&rsquo;s paid; the poet or the musician&mdash;just the same; the
      tramp&mdash;he&rsquo;s no different. The tramp goes to the workhouse in the end,
      and is paid for with other people&rsquo;s money. Miss Schlegel the real thing&rsquo;s
      money, and all the rest is a dream.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re still wrong. You&rsquo;ve forgotten Death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Leonard could not understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we lived forever, what you say would be true. But we have to die, we
      have to leave life presently. Injustice and greed would be the real thing
      if we lived for ever. As it is, we must hold to other things, because
      Death is coming. I love Death&mdash;not morbidly, but because He explains.
      He shows me the emptiness of Money. Death and Money are the eternal foes.
      Not Death and Life. Never mind what lies behind Death, Mr. Bast, but be
      sure that the poet and the musician and the tramp will be happier in it
      than the man who has never learnt to say, &lsquo;I am I.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are all in a mist&mdash;I know, but I can help you this far&mdash;men
      like the Wilcoxes are deeper in the mist than any. Sane, sound Englishmen!
      building up empires, levelling all the world into what they call common
      sense. But mention Death to them and they&rsquo;re offended, because Death&rsquo;s
      really Imperial, and He cries out against them for ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am as afraid of Death as any one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But not of the idea of Death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what is the difference?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Infinite difference,&rdquo; said Helen, more gravely than before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard looked at her wondering, and had the sense of great things
      sweeping out of the shrouded night. But he could not receive them, because
      his heart was still full of little things. As the lost umbrella had spoilt
      the concert at Queen&rsquo;s Hall, so the lost situation was obscuring the
      diviner harmonies now. Death, Life, and Materialism were fine words, but
      would Mr. Wilcox take him on as a clerk? Talk as one would, Mr. Wilcox was
      king of this world, the superman, with his own morality, whose head
      remained in the clouds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must be stupid,&rdquo; he said apologetically.
    </p>
    <p>
      While to Helen the paradox became clearer and clearer. &ldquo;Death destroys a
      man: the idea of Death saves him.&rdquo; Behind the coffins and the skeletons
      that stay the vulgar mind lies something so immense that all that is great
      in us responds to it. Men of the world may recoil from the charnel-house
      that they will one day enter, but Love knows better. Death is his foe, but
      his peer, and in their age-long struggle the thews of Love have been
      strengthened, and his vision cleared, until there is no one who can stand
      against him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So never give in,&rdquo; continued the girl, and restated again and again the
      vague yet convincing plea that the Invisible lodges against the Visible.
      Her excitement grew as she tried to cut the rope that fastened Leonard to
      the earth. Woven of bitter experience, it resisted her. Presently the
      waitress entered and gave her a letter from Margaret. Another note,
      addressed to Leonard, was inside. They read them, listening to the
      murmurings of the river.
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      For many hours Margaret did nothing; then she controlled herself, and
      wrote some letters. She was too bruised to speak to Henry; she could pity
      him, and even determine to marry him, but as yet all lay too deep in her
      heart for speech. On the surface the sense of his degradation was too
      strong. She could not command voice or look, and the gentle words that she
      forced out through her pen seemed to proceed from some other person.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dearest boy,&rdquo; she began, &ldquo;this is not to part us. It is everything or
      nothing, and I mean it to be nothing. It happened long before we ever met,
      and even if it had happened since, I should be writing the same, I hope. I
      do understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But she crossed out &ldquo;I do understand&rdquo;; it struck a false note. Henry could
      not bear to be understood. She also crossed out, &ldquo;It is everything or
      nothing.&rdquo; Henry would resent so strong a grasp of the situation. She must
      not comment; comment is unfeminine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think that&rsquo;ll about do,&rdquo; she thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the sense of his degradation choked her. Was he worth all this
      bother? To have yielded to a woman of that sort was everything, yes, it
      was, and she could not be his wife. She tried to translate his temptation
      into her own language, and her brain reeled. Men must be different even to
      want to yield to such a temptation. Her belief in comradeship was stifled,
      and she saw life as from that glass saloon on the Great Western which
      sheltered male and female alike from the fresh air. Are the sexes really
      races, each with its own code of morality, and their mutual love a mere
      device of Nature to keep things going? Strip human intercourse of the
      proprieties, and is it reduced to this? Her judgment told her no. She knew
      that out of Nature&rsquo;s device we have built a magic that will win us
      immortality. Far more mysterious than the call of sex to sex is the
      tenderness that we throw into that call; far wider is the gulf between us
      and the farmyard than between the farmyard and the garbage that nourishes
      it. We are evolving, in ways that Science cannot measure, to ends that
      Theology dares not contemplate. &ldquo;Men did produce one jewel,&rdquo; the gods will
      say, and, saying, will give us immortality. Margaret knew all this, but
      for the moment she could not feel it, and transformed the marriage of Evie
      and Mr. Cahill into a carnival of fools, and her own marriage&mdash;too
      miserable to think of that, she tore up the letter, and then wrote
      another:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;DEAR MR. BAST,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have spoken to Mr. Wilcox about you, as I promised, and am sorry to say
      that he has no vacancy for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yours truly,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. J. SCHLEGEL.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She enclosed this in a note to Helen, over which she took less trouble
      than she might have done; but her head was aching, and she could not stop
      to pick her words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;DEAR HELEN,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give him this. The Basts are no good. Henry found the woman drunk on the
      lawn. I am having a room got ready for you here, and will you please come
      round at once on getting this? The Basts are not at all the type we should
      trouble about. I may go round to them myself in the morning, and do
      anything that is fair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In writing this, Margaret felt that she was being practical. Something
      might be arranged for the Basts later on, but they must be silenced for
      the moment. She hoped to avoid a conversation between the woman and Helen.
      She rang the bell for a servant, but no one answered it; Mr. Wilcox and
      the Warringtons were gone to bed, and the kitchen was abandoned to
      Saturnalia. Consequently she went over to the George herself. She did not
      enter the hotel, for discussion would have been perilous, and, saying that
      the letter was important, she gave it to the waitress. As she recrossed
      the square she saw Helen and Mr. Bast looking out of the window of the
      coffee-room, and feared she was already too late. Her task was not yet
      over; she ought to tell Henry what she had done.
    </p>
    <p>
      This came easily, for she saw him in the hall. The night wind had been
      rattling the pictures against the wall, and the noise had disturbed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; he called, quite the householder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret walked in and past him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have asked Helen to sleep,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;She is best here; so don&rsquo;t lock
      the front-door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought some one had got in,&rdquo; said Henry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the same time I told the man that we could do nothing for him. I don&rsquo;t
      know about later, but now the Basts must clearly go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you say that your sister is sleeping here, after all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she to be shown up to your room?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have naturally nothing to say to her; I am going to bed. Will you tell
      the servants about Helen? Could some one go to carry her bag?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He tapped a little gong, which had been bought to summon the servants.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must make more noise than that if you want them to hear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Henry opened a door, and down the corridor came shouts of laughter. &ldquo;Far
      too much screaming there,&rdquo; he said, and strode towards it. Margaret went
      upstairs, uncertain whether to be glad that they had met, or sorry. They
      had behaved as if nothing had happened, and her deepest instincts told her
      that this was wrong. For his own sake, some explanation was due.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet&mdash;what could an explanation tell her? A date, a place, a few
      details, which she could imagine all too clearly. Now that the first shock
      was over, she saw that there was every reason to premise a Mrs. Bast.
      Henry&rsquo;s inner life had long laid open to her&mdash;his intellectual
      confusion, his obtuseness to personal influence, his strong but furtive
      passions. Should she refuse him because his outer life corresponded?
      Perhaps. Perhaps, if the dishonour had been done to her, but it was done
      long before her day. She struggled against the feeling. She told herself
      that Mrs. Wilcox&rsquo;s wrong was her own. But she was not a barren theorist.
      As she undressed, her anger, her regard for the dead, her desire for a
      scene, all grew weak. Henry must have it as he liked, for she loved him,
      and some day she would use her love to make him a better man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pity was at the bottom of her actions all through this crisis. Pity, if
      one may generalise, is at the bottom of woman. When men like us, it is for
      our better qualities, and however tender their liking, we dare not be
      unworthy of it, or they will quietly let us go. But unworthiness
      stimulates woman. It brings out her deeper nature, for good or for evil.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here was the core of the question. Henry must be forgiven, and made better
      by love; nothing else mattered. Mrs. Wilcox, that unquiet yet kindly
      ghost, must be left to her own wrong. To her everything was in proportion
      now, and she, too, would pity the man who was blundering up and down their
      lives. Had Mrs. Wilcox known of his trespass? An interesting question, but
      Margaret fell asleep, tethered by affection, and lulled by the murmurs of
      the river that descended all the night from Wales. She felt herself at one
      with her future home, colouring it and coloured by it, and awoke to see,
      for the second time, Oniton Castle conquering the morning mists.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIX
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Henry dear&mdash;&rdquo; was her greeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had finished his breakfast, and was beginning the Times. His
      sister-in-law was packing. Margaret knelt by him and took the paper from
      him, feeling that it was unusually heavy and thick. Then, putting her face
      where it had been, she looked up in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Henry dear, look at me. No, I won&rsquo;t have you shirking. Look at me. There.
      That&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re referring to last evening,&rdquo; he said huskily. &ldquo;I have released you
      from your engagement. I could find excuses, but I won&rsquo;t. No, I won&rsquo;t. A
      thousand times no. I&rsquo;m a bad lot, and must be left at that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Expelled from his old fortress, Mr. Wilcox was building a new one. He
      could no longer appear respectable to her, so he defended himself instead
      in a lurid past. It was not true repentance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave it where you will, boy. It&rsquo;s not going to trouble us; I know what
      I&rsquo;m talking about, and it will make no difference.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No difference?&rdquo; he inquired. &ldquo;No difference, when you find that I am not
      the fellow you thought?&rdquo; He was annoyed with Miss Schlegel here. He would
      have preferred her to be prostrated by the blow, or even to rage. Against
      the tide of his sin flowed the feeling that she was not altogether
      womanly. Her eyes gazed too straight; they had read books that are
      suitable for men only. And though he had dreaded a scene, and though she
      had determined against one, there was a scene, all the same. It was
      somehow imperative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am unworthy of you,&rdquo; he began. &ldquo;Had I been worthy, I should not have
      released you from your engagement. I know what I am talking about. I can&rsquo;t
      bear to talk of such things. We had better leave it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She kissed his hand. He jerked it from her, and, rising to his feet, went
      on: &ldquo;You, with your sheltered life, and refined pursuits, and friends, and
      books, you and your sister, and women like you&mdash;I say, how can you
      guess the temptations that lie round a man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is difficult for us,&rdquo; said Margaret; &ldquo;but if we are worth marrying, we
      do guess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cut off from decent society and family ties, what do you suppose happens
      to thousands of young fellows overseas? Isolated. No one near. I know by
      bitter experience, and yet you say it makes &lsquo;no difference.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laughed bitterly. Margaret went to the sideboard and helped herself to
      one of the breakfast dishes. Being the last down, she turned out the
      spirit-lamp that kept them warm. She was tender, but grave. She knew that
      Henry was not so much confessing his soul as pointing out the gulf between
      the male soul and the female, and she did not desire to hear him on this
      point.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did Helen come?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that won&rsquo;t do at all, at all! We don&rsquo;t want her gossiping with Mrs.
      Bast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good God! no!&rdquo; he exclaimed, suddenly natural. Then he caught himself up.
      &ldquo;Let them gossip, my game&rsquo;s up, though I thank you for your unselfishness&mdash;little
      as my thanks are worth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t she send me a message or anything?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard of none.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you ring the bell, please?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, to inquire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He swaggered up to it tragically, and sounded a peal. Margaret poured
      herself out some coffee. The butler came, and said that Miss Schlegel had
      slept at the George, so far as he had heard. Should he go round to the
      George?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go, thank you,&rdquo; said Margaret, and dismissed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is no good,&rdquo; said Henry. &ldquo;Those things leak out; you cannot stop a
      story once it has started. I have known cases of other men&mdash;I
      despised them once, I thought that I&rsquo;m different, I shall never be
      tempted. Oh, Margaret&mdash;&rdquo; He came and sat down near her, improvising
      emotion. She could not bear to listen to him. &ldquo;We fellows all come to
      grief once in our time. Will you believe that? There are moments when the
      strongest man&mdash;&lsquo;Let him who standeth, take heed lest he fall.&rsquo; That&rsquo;s
      true, isn&rsquo;t it? If you knew all, you would excuse me. I was far from good
      influences&mdash;far even from England. I was very, very lonely, and
      longed for a woman&rsquo;s voice. That&rsquo;s enough. I have told you too much
      already for you to forgive me now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s enough, dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have&rdquo;&mdash;he lowered his voice&mdash;&ldquo;I have been through hell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gravely she considered this claim. Had he? Had he suffered tortures of
      remorse, or had it been, &ldquo;There! that&rsquo;s over. Now for respectable life
      again&rdquo;? The latter, if she read him rightly. A man who has been through
      hell does not boast of his virility. He is humble and hides it, if,
      indeed, it still exists. Only in legend does the sinner come forth
      penitent, but terrible, to conquer pure woman by his resistless power.
      Henry was anxious to be terrible, but had not got it in him. He was a good
      average Englishman, who had slipped. The really culpable point&mdash;his
      faithlessness to Mrs. Wilcox&mdash;never seemed to strike him. She longed
      to mention Mrs. Wilcox.
    </p>
    <p>
      And bit by bit the story was told her. It was a very simple story. Ten
      years ago was the time, a garrison town in Cyprus the place. Now and then
      he asked her whether she could possibly forgive him, and she answered, &ldquo;I
      have already forgiven you, Henry.&rdquo; She chose her words carefully, and so
      saved him from panic. She played the girl, until he could rebuild his
      fortress and hide his soul from the world. When the butler came to clear
      away, Henry was in a very different mood&mdash;asked the fellow what he
      was in such a hurry for, complained of the noise last night in the
      servants&rsquo; hall. Margaret looked intently at the butler. He, as a handsome
      young man, was faintly attractive to her as a woman&mdash;an attraction so
      faint as scarcely to be perceptible, yet the skies would have fallen if
      she had mentioned it to Henry.
    </p>
    <p>
      On her return from the George the building operations were complete, and
      the old Henry fronted her, competent, cynical, and kind. He had made a
      clean breast, had been forgiven, and the great thing now was to forget his
      failure, and to send it the way of other unsuccessful investments. Jacky
      rejoined Howards End and Dude Street, and the vermilion motor-car, and the
      Argentine Hard Dollars, and all the things and people for whom he had
      never had much use and had less now. Their memory hampered him. He could
      scarcely attend to Margaret, who brought back disquieting news from the
      George. Helen and her clients had gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, let them go&mdash;the man and his wife, I mean, for the more we see
      of your sister the better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But they have gone separately&mdash;Helen very early, the Basts just
      before I arrived. They have left no message. They have answered neither of
      my notes. I don&rsquo;t like to think what it all means.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you say in the notes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you last night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;ah&mdash;yes! Dear, would you like one turn in the garden?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret took his arm. The beautiful weather soothed her. But the wheels
      of Evie&rsquo;s wedding were still at work, tossing the guests outwards as
      deftly as they had drawn them in, and she could not be with him long. It
      had been arranged that they should motor to Shrewsbury, whence he would go
      north, and she back to London with the Warringtons. For a fraction of time
      she was happy. Then her brain recommenced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid there has been gossiping of some kind at the George. Helen
      would not have left unless she had heard something. I mismanaged that. It
      is wretched. I ought to have parted her from that woman at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Margaret!&rdquo; he exclaimed, loosing her arm impressively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes, Henry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am far from a saint&mdash;in fact, the reverse&mdash;but you have taken
      me, for better or worse. Bygones must be bygones. You have promised to
      forgive me. Margaret, a promise is a promise. Never mention that woman
      again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Except for some practical reason&mdash;never.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Practical! You practical!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m practical,&rdquo; she murmured, stooping over the mowing-machine and
      playing with the grass which trickled through her fingers like sand.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had silenced her, but her fears made him uneasy. Not for the first
      time, he was threatened with blackmail. He was rich and supposed to be
      moral; the Basts knew that he was not, and might find it profitable to
      hint as much.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At all events, you mustn&rsquo;t worry,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This is a man&rsquo;s business.&rdquo;
       He thought intently. &ldquo;On no account mention it to anybody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret flushed at advice so elementary, but he was really paving the way
      for a lie. If necessary he would deny that he had ever known Mrs. Bast,
      and prosecute her for libel. Perhaps he never had known her. Here was
      Margaret, who behaved as if he had not. There the house. Round them were
      half a dozen gardeners, clearing up after his daughter&rsquo;s wedding. All was
      so solid and spruce, that the past flew up out of sight like a
      spring-blind, leaving only the last five minutes unrolled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Glancing at these, he saw that the car would be round during the next
      five, and plunged into action. Gongs were tapped, orders issued, Margaret
      was sent to dress, and the housemaid to sweep up the long trickle of grass
      that she had left across the hall. As is Man to the Universe, so was the
      mind of Mr. Wilcox to the minds of some men&mdash;a concentrated light
      upon a tiny spot, a little Ten Minutes moving self-contained through its
      appointed years. No Pagan he, who lives for the Now, and may be wiser than
      all philosophers. He lived for the five minutes that have past, and the
      five to come; he had the business mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      How did he stand now, as his motor slipped out of Oniton and breasted the
      great round hills? Margaret had heard a certain rumour, but was all right.
      She had forgiven him, God bless her, and he felt the manlier for it.
      Charles and Evie had not heard it, and never must hear. No more must Paul.
      Over his children he felt great tenderness, which he did not try to track
      to a cause; Mrs. Wilcox was too far back in his life. He did not connect
      her with the sudden aching love that he felt for Evie. Poor little Evie!
      he trusted that Cahill would make her a decent husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Margaret? How did she stand?
    </p>
    <p>
      She had several minor worries. Clearly her sister had heard something. She
      dreaded meeting her in town. And she was anxious about Leonard, for whom
      they certainly were responsible. Nor ought Mrs. Bast to starve. But the
      main situation had not altered. She still loved Henry. His actions, not
      his disposition, had disappointed her, and she could bear that. And she
      loved her future home. Standing up in the car, just where she had leapt
      from it two days before, she gazed back with deep emotion upon Oniton.
      Besides the Grange and the Castle keep, she could now pick out the church
      and the black-and-white gables of the George. There was the bridge, and
      the river nibbling its green peninsula. She could even see the
      bathing-shed, but while she was looking for Charles&rsquo;s new spring-board,
      the forehead of the hill rose and hid the whole scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      She never saw it again. Day and night the river flows down into England,
      day after day the sun retreats into the Welsh mountains, and the tower
      chimes, See the Conquering Hero. But the Wilcoxes have no part in the
      place, nor in any place. It is not their names that recur in the parish
      register. It is not their ghosts that sigh among the alders at evening.
      They have swept into the valley and swept out of it, leaving a little dust
      and a little money behind.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXX
    </h2>
    <p>
      Tibby was now approaching his last year at Oxford. He had moved out of
      college, and was contemplating the Universe, or such portions of it as
      concerned him, from his comfortable lodgings in Long Wall. He was not
      concerned with much. When a young man is untroubled by passions and
      sincerely indifferent to public opinion his outlook is necessarily
      limited. Tibby wished neither to strengthen the position of the rich nor
      to improve that of the poor, and so was well content to watch the elms
      nodding behind the mildly embattled parapets of Magdalen. There are worse
      lives. Though selfish, he was never cruel; though affected in manner, he
      never posed. Like Margaret, he disdained the heroic equipment, and it was
      only after many visits that men discovered Schlegel to possess a character
      and a brain. He had done well in Mods, much to the surprise of those who
      attended lectures and took proper exercise, and was now glancing
      disdainfully at Chinese in case he should some day consent to qualify as a
      Student Interpreter. To him thus employed Helen entered. A telegram had
      preceded her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He noticed, in a distant way, that his sister had altered.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a rule he found her too pronounced, and had never come across this look
      of appeal, pathetic yet dignified&mdash;the look of a sailor who has lost
      everything at sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have come from Oniton,&rdquo; she began. &ldquo;There has been a great deal of
      trouble there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s for lunch?&rdquo; said Tibby, picking up the claret, which was warming in
      the hearth. Helen sat down submissively at the table. &ldquo;Why such an early
      start?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sunrise or something&mdash;when I could get away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I surmise. Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s to be done, Tibby. I am very much upset at a piece of
      news that concerns Meg, and do not want to face her, and I am not going
      back to Wickham Place. I stopped here to tell you this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The landlady came in with the cutlets. Tibby put a marker in the leaves of
      his Chinese Grammar and helped them. Oxford&mdash;the Oxford of the
      vacation&mdash;dreamed and rustled outside, and indoors the little fire
      was coated with grey where the sunshine touched it. Helen continued her
      odd story.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give Meg my love and say that I want to be alone. I mean to go to Munich
      or else Bonn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such a message is easily given,&rdquo; said her brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As regards Wickham Place and my share of the furniture, you and she are
      to do exactly as you like. My own feeling is that everything may just as
      well be sold. What does one want with dusty economic books, which have
      made the world no better, or with mother&rsquo;s hideous chiffoniers? I have
      also another commission for you. I want you to deliver a letter.&rdquo; She got
      up. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t written it yet. Why shouldn&rsquo;t I post it, though?&rdquo; She sat
      down again. &ldquo;My head is rather wretched. I hope that none of your friends
      are likely to come in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tibby locked the door. His friends often found it in this condition. Then
      he asked whether anything had gone wrong at Evie&rsquo;s wedding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not there,&rdquo; said Helen, and burst into tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had known her hysterical&mdash;it was one of her aspects with which he
      had no concern&mdash;and yet these tears touched him as something unusual.
      They were nearer the things that did concern him, such as music. He laid
      down his knife and looked at her curiously. Then, as she continued to sob,
      he went on with his lunch.
    </p>
    <p>
      The time came for the second course, and she was still crying. Apple
      Charlotte was to follow, which spoils by waiting. &ldquo;Do you mind Mrs.
      Martlett coming in?&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;or shall I take it from her at the door?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could I bathe my eyes, Tibby?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took her to his bedroom, and introduced the pudding in her absence.
      Having helped himself, he put it down to warm in the hearth. His hand
      stretched towards the Grammar, and soon he was turning over the pages,
      raising his eyebrows scornfully, perhaps at human nature, perhaps at
      Chinese. To him thus employed Helen returned. She had pulled herself
      together, but the grave appeal had not vanished from her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now for the explanation,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t I begin with it? I have
      found out something about Mr. Wilcox. He has behaved very wrongly indeed,
      and ruined two people&rsquo;s lives. It all came on me very suddenly last night;
      I am very much upset, and I do not know what to do. Mrs. Bast&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, those people!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen seemed silenced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I lock the door again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No thanks, Tibbikins. You&rsquo;re being very good to me. I want to tell you
      the story before I go abroad, you must do exactly what you like&mdash;treat
      it as part of the furniture. Meg cannot have heard it yet, I think. But I
      cannot face her and tell her that the man she is going to marry has
      misconducted himself. I don&rsquo;t even know whether she ought to be told.
      Knowing as she does that I dislike him, she will suspect me, and think
      that I want to ruin her match. I simply don&rsquo;t know what to make of such a
      thing. I trust your judgment. What would you do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I gather he has had a mistress,&rdquo; said Tibby.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen flushed with shame and anger. &ldquo;And ruined two people&rsquo;s lives. And
      goes about saying that personal actions count for nothing, and there
      always will be rich and poor. He met her when he was trying to get rich
      out in Cyprus&mdash;I don&rsquo;t wish to make him worse than he is, and no
      doubt she was ready enough to meet him. But there it is. They met. He goes
      his way and she goes hers. What do you suppose is the end of such women?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He conceded that it was a bad business.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They end in two ways: Either they sink till the lunatic asylums and the
      workhouses are full of them, and cause Mr. Wilcox to write letters to the
      papers complaining of our national degeneracy, or else they entrap a boy
      into marriage before it is too late. She&mdash;I can&rsquo;t blame her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this isn&rsquo;t all,&rdquo; she continued after a long pause, during which the
      landlady served them with coffee. &ldquo;I come now to the business that took us
      to Oniton. We went all three. Acting on Mr. Wilcox&rsquo;s advice, the man
      throws up a secure situation and takes an insecure one, from which he is
      dismissed. There are certain excuses, but in the main Mr. Wilcox is to
      blame, as Meg herself admitted. It is only common justice that he should
      employ the man himself. But he meets the woman, and, like the cur that he
      is, he refuses, and tries to get rid of them. He makes Meg write. Two
      notes came from her late that evening&mdash;one for me, one for Leonard,
      dismissing him with barely a reason. I couldn&rsquo;t understand. Then it comes
      out that Mrs. Bast had spoken to Mr. Wilcox on the lawn while we left her
      to get rooms, and was still speaking about him when Leonard came back to
      her. This Leonard knew all along. He thought it natural he should be
      ruined twice. Natural! Could you have contained yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is certainly a very bad business,&rdquo; said Tibby.
    </p>
    <p>
      His reply seemed to calm his sister. &ldquo;I was afraid that I saw it out of
      proportion. But you are right outside it, and you must know. In a day or
      two&mdash;or perhaps a week&mdash;take whatever steps you think fit. I
      leave it in your hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She concluded her charge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The facts as they touch Meg are all before you,&rdquo; she added; and Tibby
      sighed and felt it rather hard that, because of his open mind, he should
      be empanelled to serve as a juror. He had never been interested in human
      beings, for which one must blame him, but he had had rather too much of
      them at Wickham Place. Just as some people cease to attend when books are
      mentioned, so Tibby&rsquo;s attention wandered when &ldquo;personal relations&rdquo; came
      under discussion. Ought Margaret to know what Helen knew the Basts to
      know? Similar questions had vexed him from infancy, and at Oxford he had
      learned to say that the importance of human beings has been vastly
      overrated by specialists. The epigram, with its faint whiff of the
      eighties, meant nothing. But he might have let it off now if his sister
      had not been ceaselessly beautiful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, Helen&mdash;have a cigarette&mdash;I don&rsquo;t see what I&rsquo;m to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then there&rsquo;s nothing to be done. I dare say you are right. Let them
      marry. There remains the question of compensation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you want me to adjudicate that too? Had you not better consult an
      expert?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This part is in confidence,&rdquo; said Helen. &ldquo;It has nothing to do with Meg,
      and do not mention it to her. The compensation&mdash;I do not see who is
      to pay it if I don&rsquo;t, and I have already decided on the minimum sum. As
      soon as possible I am placing it to your account, and when I am in Germany
      you will pay it over for me. I shall never forget your kindness,
      Tibbikins, if you do this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the sum?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Five thousand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good God alive!&rdquo; said Tibby, and went crimson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, what is the good of driblets? To go through life having done one
      thing&mdash;to have raised one person from the abyss; not these puny gifts
      of shillings and blankets&mdash;making the grey more grey. No doubt people
      will think me extraordinary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care an iota what people think!&rdquo; cried he, heated to unusual
      manliness of diction. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s half what you have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not nearly half.&rdquo; She spread out her hands over her soiled skirt. &ldquo;I have
      far too much, and we settled at Chelsea last spring that three hundred a
      year is necessary to set a man on his feet. What I give will bring in a
      hundred and fifty between two. It isn&rsquo;t enough.&rdquo; He could not recover. He
      was not angry or even shocked, and he saw that Helen would still have
      plenty to live on. But it amazed him to think what haycocks people can
      make of their lives. His delicate intonations would not work, and he could
      only blurt out that the five thousand pounds would mean a great deal of
      bother for him personally.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t expect you to understand me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I? I understand nobody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you&rsquo;ll do it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Apparently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I leave you two commissions, then. The first concerns Mr. Wilcox, and you
      are to use your discretion. The second concerns the money, and is to be
      mentioned to no one, and carried out literally. You will send a hundred
      pounds on account to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He walked with her to the station, passing through those streets whose
      serried beauty never bewildered him and never fatigued. The lovely
      creature raised domes and spires into the cloudless blue, and only the
      ganglion of vulgarity round Carfax showed how evanescent was the phantom,
      how faint its claim to represent England. Helen, rehearsing her
      commission, noticed nothing; the Basts were in her brain, and she retold
      the crisis in a meditative way, which might have made other men curious.
      She was seeing whether it would hold. He asked her once why she had taken
      the Basts right into the heart of Evie&rsquo;s wedding. She stopped like a
      frightened animal and said, &ldquo;Does that seem to you so odd?&rdquo; Her eyes, the
      hand laid on the mouth, quite haunted him, until they were absorbed into
      the figure of St. Mary the Virgin, before whom he paused for a moment on
      the walk home.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is convenient to follow him in the discharge of his duties. Margaret
      summoned him the next day. She was terrified at Helen&rsquo;s flight, and he had
      to say that she had called in at Oxford. Then she said: &ldquo;Did she seem
      worried at any rumour about Henry?&rdquo; He answered, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; &ldquo;I knew it was
      that!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll write to her.&rdquo; Tibby was relieved.
    </p>
    <p>
      He then sent the cheque to the address that Helen gave him, and stated
      that he was instructed to forward later on five thousand pounds. An answer
      came back very civil and quiet in tone&mdash;such an answer as Tibby
      himself would have given. The cheque was returned, the legacy refused, the
      writer being in no need of money. Tibby forwarded this to Helen, adding in
      the fulness of his heart that Leonard Bast seemed somewhat a monumental
      person after all. Helen&rsquo;s reply was frantic. He was to take no notice. He
      was to go down at once and say that she commanded acceptance. He went. A
      scurf of books and china ornaments awaited him. The Basts had just been
      evicted for not paying their rent, and had wandered no one knew whither.
      Helen had begun bungling with her money by this time, and had even sold
      out her shares in the Nottingham and Derby Railway. For some weeks she did
      nothing. Then she reinvested, and, owing to the good advice of her
      stockbrokers, became rather richer than she had been before.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXI
    </h2>
    <p>
      Houses have their own ways of dying, falling as variously as the
      generations of men, some with a tragic roar, some quietly, but to an
      after-life in the city of ghosts, while from others&mdash;and thus was the
      death of Wickham Place&mdash;the spirit slips before the body perishes. It
      had decayed in the spring, disintegrating the girls more than they knew,
      and causing either to accost unfamiliar regions. By September it was a
      corpse, void of emotion, and scarcely hallowed by the memories of thirty
      years of happiness. Through its round-topped doorway passed furniture, and
      pictures, and books, until the last room was gutted and the last van had
      rumbled away. It stood for a week or two longer, open-eyed, as if
      astonished at its own emptiness. Then it fell. Navvies came, and spilt it
      back into the grey. With their muscles and their beery good temper, they
      were not the worst of undertakers for a house which had always been human,
      and had not mistaken culture for an end.
    </p>
    <p>
      The furniture, with a few exceptions, went down into Hertfordshire, Mr.
      Wilcox having most kindly offered Howards End as a warehouse. Mr. Bryce
      had died abroad&mdash;an unsatisfactory affair&mdash;and as there seemed
      little guarantee that the rent would be paid regularly, he cancelled the
      agreement, and resumed possession himself. Until he relet the house, the
      Schlegels were welcome to stack their furniture in the garage and lower
      rooms. Margaret demurred, but Tibby accepted the offer gladly; it saved
      him from coming to any decision about the future. The plate and the more
      valuable pictures found a safer home in London, but the bulk of the things
      went country-ways, and were entrusted to the guardianship of Miss Avery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shortly before the move, our hero and heroine were married. They have
      weathered the storm, and may reasonably expect peace. To have no illusions
      and yet to love&mdash;what stronger surety can a woman find? She had seen
      her husband&rsquo;s past as well as his heart. She knew her own heart with a
      thoroughness that commonplace people believe impossible. The heart of Mrs.
      Wilcox was alone hidden, and perhaps it is superstitious to speculate on
      the feelings of the dead. They were married quietly&mdash;really quietly,
      for as the day approached she refused to go through another Oniton. Her
      brother gave her away, her aunt, who was out of health, presided over a
      few colourless refreshments. The Wilcoxes were represented by Charles, who
      witnessed the marriage settlement, and by Mr. Cahill. Paul did send a
      cablegram. In a few minutes, and without the aid of music, the clergyman
      made them man and wife, and soon the glass shade had fallen that cuts off
      married couples from the world. She, a monogamist, regretted the cessation
      of some of life&rsquo;s innocent odours; he, whose instincts were polygamous,
      felt morally braced by the change and less liable to the temptations that
      had assailed him in the past.
    </p>
    <p>
      They spent their honeymoon near Innsbruck. Henry knew of a reliable hotel
      there, and Margaret hoped for a meeting with her sister. In this she was
      disappointed. As they came south, Helen retreated over the Brenner, and
      wrote an unsatisfactory post-card from the shores of the Lake of Garda,
      saying that her plans were uncertain and had better be ignored. Evidently
      she disliked meeting Henry. Two months are surely enough to accustom an
      outsider to a situation which a wife has accepted in two days, and
      Margaret had again to regret her sister&rsquo;s lack of self-control. In a long
      letter she pointed out the need of charity in sexual matters; so little is
      known about them; it is hard enough for those who are personally touched
      to judge; then how futile must be the verdict of Society. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t say
      there is no standard, for that would destroy morality; only that there can
      be no standard until our impulses are classified and better understood.&rdquo;
       Helen thanked her for her kind letter&mdash;rather a curious reply. She
      moved south again, and spoke of wintering in Naples.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wilcox was not sorry that the meeting failed. Helen left him time to
      grow skin over his wound. There were still moments when it pained him. Had
      he only known that Margaret was awaiting him&mdash;Margaret, so lively and
      intelligent, and yet so submissive&mdash;he would have kept himself
      worthier of her. Incapable of grouping the past, he confused the episode
      of Jacky with another episode that had taken place in the days of his
      bachelorhood. The two made one crop of wild oats, for which he was
      heartily sorry, and he could not see that those oats are of a darker stock
      which are rooted in another&rsquo;s dishonour. Unchastity and infidelity were as
      confused to him as to the Middle Ages, his only moral teacher. Ruth (poor
      old Ruth!) did not enter into his calculations at all, for poor old Ruth
      had never found him out.
    </p>
    <p>
      His affection for his present wife grew steadily. Her cleverness gave him
      no trouble, and, indeed, he liked to see her reading poetry or something
      about social questions; it distinguished her from the wives of other men.
      He had only to call, and she clapped the book up and was ready to do what
      he wished. Then they would argue so jollily, and once or twice she had him
      in quite a tight corner, but as soon as he grew really serious, she gave
      in. Man is for war, woman for the recreation of the warrior, but he does
      not dislike it if she makes a show of fight. She cannot win in a real
      battle, having no muscles, only nerves. Nerves make her jump out of a
      moving motor-car, or refuse to be married fashionably. The warrior may
      well allow her to triumph on such occasions; they move not the
      imperishable plinth of things that touch his peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret had a bad attack of these nerves during the honeymoon. He told
      her&mdash;casually, as was his habit&mdash;that Oniton Grange was let. She
      showed her annoyance, and asked rather crossly why she had not been
      consulted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to bother you,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Besides, I have only heard for
      certain this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are we to live?&rdquo; said Margaret, trying to laugh. &ldquo;I loved the place
      extraordinarily. Don&rsquo;t you believe in having a permanent home, Henry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He assured her that she misunderstood him. It is home life that
      distinguishes us from the foreigner. But he did not believe in a damp
      home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is news. I never heard till this minute that Oniton was damp.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear girl!&rdquo;&mdash;he flung out his hand&mdash;&ldquo;have you eyes? have you
      a skin? How could it be anything but damp in such a situation? In the
      first place, the Grange is on clay, and built where the castle moat must
      have been; then there&rsquo;s that detestable little river, steaming all night
      like a kettle. Feel the cellar walls; look up under the eaves. Ask Sir
      James or any one. Those Shropshire valleys are notorious. The only
      possible place for a house in Shropshire is on a hill; but, for my part, I
      think the country is too far from London, and the scenery nothing
      special.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret could not resist saying, &ldquo;Why did you go there, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;because&mdash;&rdquo; He drew his head back and grew rather angry. &ldquo;Why
      have we come to the Tyrol, if it comes to that? One might go on asking
      such questions indefinitely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One might; but he was only gaining time for a plausible answer. Out it
      came, and he believed it as soon as it was spoken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The truth is, I took Oniton on account of Evie. Don&rsquo;t let this go any
      further.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t like her to know that she nearly let me in for a very bad
      bargain. No sooner did I sign the agreement than she got engaged. Poor
      little girl! She was so keen on it all, and wouldn&rsquo;t even wait to make
      proper inquiries about the shooting. Afraid it would get snapped up&mdash;just
      like all of your sex. Well, no harm&rsquo;s done. She has had her country
      wedding, and I&rsquo;ve got rid of my goose to some fellows who are starting a
      preparatory school.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where shall we live, then, Henry? I should enjoy living somewhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not yet decided. What about Norfolk?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret was silent. Marriage had not saved her from the sense of flux.
      London was but a foretaste of this nomadic civilisation which is altering
      human nature so profoundly, and throws upon personal relations a stress
      greater than they have ever borne before. Under cosmopolitanism, if it
      comes, we shall receive no help from the earth. Trees and meadows and
      mountains will only be a spectacle, and the binding force that they once
      exercised on character must be entrusted to Love alone. May Love be equal
      to the task!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is now what?&rdquo; continued Henry. &ldquo;Nearly October. Let us camp for the
      winter at Ducie Street, and look out for something in the spring.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If possible, something permanent. I can&rsquo;t be as young as I was, for these
      alterations don&rsquo;t suit me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my dear, which would you rather have&mdash;alterations or
      rheumatism?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see your point,&rdquo; said Margaret, getting up. &ldquo;If Oniton is really damp,
      it is impossible, and must be inhabited by little boys. Only, in the
      spring, let us look before we leap. I will take warning by Evie, and not
      hurry you. Remember that you have a free hand this time. These endless
      moves must be bad for the furniture, and are certainly expensive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a practical little woman it is! What&rsquo;s it been reading? Theo&mdash;theo&mdash;how
      much?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Theosophy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Ducie Street was her first fate&mdash;a pleasant enough fate. The
      house, being only a little larger than Wickham Place, trained her for the
      immense establishment that was promised in the spring. They were
      frequently away, but at home life ran fairly regularly. In the morning
      Henry went to business, and his sandwich&mdash;a relic this of some
      prehistoric craving&mdash;was always cut by her own hand. He did not rely
      upon the sandwich for lunch, but liked to have it by him in case he grew
      hungry at eleven. When he had gone, there was the house to look after, and
      the servants to humanise, and several kettles of Helen&rsquo;s to keep on the
      boil. Her conscience pricked her a little about the Basts; she was not
      sorry to have lost sight of them. No doubt Leonard was worth helping, but
      being Henry&rsquo;s wife, she preferred to help some one else. As for theatres
      and discussion societies, they attracted her less and less. She began to
      &ldquo;miss&rdquo; new movements, and to spend her spare time re-reading or thinking,
      rather to the concern of her Chelsea friends. They attributed the change
      to her marriage, and perhaps some deep instinct did warn her not to travel
      further from her husband than was inevitable. Yet the main cause lay
      deeper still; she had outgrown stimulants, and was passing from words to
      things. It was doubtless a pity not to keep up with Wedekind or John, but
      some closing of the gates is inevitable after thirty, if the mind itself
      is to become a creative power.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXII
    </h2>
    <p>
      She was looking at plans one day in the following spring&mdash;they had
      finally decided to go down into Sussex and build&mdash;when Mrs. Charles
      Wilcox was announced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you heard the news?&rdquo; Dolly cried, as soon as she entered the room.
      &ldquo;Charles is so ang&mdash;I mean he is sure you know about it, or, rather,
      that you don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Dolly!&rdquo; said Margaret, placidly kissing her. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a surprise! How
      are the boys and the baby?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Boys and the baby were well, and in describing a great row that there had
      been at the Hilton Tennis Club, Dolly forgot her news. The wrong people
      had tried to get in. The rector, as representing the older inhabitants,
      had said&mdash;Charles had said&mdash;the tax-collector had said&mdash;Charles
      had regretted not saying&mdash;and she closed the description with, &ldquo;But
      lucky you, with four courts of your own at Midhurst.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be very jolly,&rdquo; replied Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are those the plans? Does it matter my seeing them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Charles has never seen the plans.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have only just arrived. Here is the ground floor&mdash;no, that&rsquo;s
      rather difficult. Try the elevation. We are to have a good many gables and
      a picturesque sky-line.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What makes it smell so funny?&rdquo; said Dolly, after a moment&rsquo;s inspection.
      She was incapable of understanding plans or maps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose the paper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And WHICH way up is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just the ordinary way up. That&rsquo;s the sky-line and the part that smells
      strongest is the sky.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, ask me another. Margaret&mdash;oh&mdash;what was I going to say?
      How&rsquo;s Helen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she never coming back to England? Every one thinks it&rsquo;s awfully odd
      she doesn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it is,&rdquo; said Margaret, trying to conceal her vexation. She was getting
      rather sore on this point. &ldquo;Helen is odd, awfully. She has now been away
      eight months.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But hasn&rsquo;t she any address?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A poste restante somewhere in Bavaria is her address. Do write her a
      line. I will look it up for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t bother. That&rsquo;s eight months she has been away, surely?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly. She left just after Evie&rsquo;s wedding. It would be eight months.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just when baby was born, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dolly sighed, and stared enviously round the drawing-room. She was
      beginning to lose her brightness and good looks. The Charles&rsquo;s were not
      well off, for Mr. Wilcox, having brought up his children with expensive
      tastes, believed in letting them shift for themselves. After all, he had
      not treated them generously. Yet another baby was expected, she told
      Margaret, and they would have to give up the motor. Margaret sympathised,
      but in a formal fashion, and Dolly little imagined that the stepmother was
      urging Mr. Wilcox to make them a more liberal allowance. She sighed again,
      and at last the particular grievance was remembered. &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; she cried,
      &ldquo;that is it: Miss Avery has been unpacking your packing-cases.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why has she done that? How unnecessary!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask another. I suppose you ordered her to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I gave no such orders. Perhaps she was airing the things. She did
      undertake to light an occasional fire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was far more than an air,&rdquo; said Dolly solemnly. &ldquo;The floor sounds
      covered with books. Charles sent me to know what is to be done, for he
      feels certain you don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Books!&rdquo; cried Margaret, moved by the holy word. &ldquo;Dolly, are you serious?
      Has she been touching our books?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t she, though! What used to be the hall&rsquo;s full of them. Charles
      thought for certain you knew of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very much obliged to you, Dolly. What can have come over Miss Avery?
      I must go down about it at once. Some of the books are my brother&rsquo;s, and
      are quite valuable. She had no right to open any of the cases.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say she&rsquo;s dotty. She was the one that never got married, you know. Oh,
      I say, perhaps, she thinks your books are wedding-presents to herself. Old
      maids are taken that way sometimes. Miss Avery hates us all like poison
      ever since her frightful dust-up with Evie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t heard of that,&rdquo; said Margaret. A visit from Dolly had its
      compensations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you know she gave Evie a present last August, and Evie returned
      it, and then&mdash;oh, goloshes! You never read such a letter as Miss
      Avery wrote.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it was wrong of Evie to return it. It wasn&rsquo;t like her to do such a
      heartless thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the present was so expensive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why does that make any difference, Dolly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still, when it costs over five pounds&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t see it, but it was a
      lovely enamel pendant from a Bond Street shop. You can&rsquo;t very well accept
      that kind of thing from a farm woman. Now, can you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You accepted a present from Miss Avery when you were married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, mine was old earthenware stuff&mdash;not worth a halfpenny. Evie&rsquo;s
      was quite different. You&rsquo;d have to ask any one to the wedding who gave you
      a pendant like that. Uncle Percy and Albert and father and Charles all
      said it was quite impossible, and when four men agree, what is a girl to
      do? Evie didn&rsquo;t want to upset the old thing, so thought a sort of joking
      letter best, and returned the pendant straight to the shop to save Miss
      Avery trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Miss Avery said&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dolly&rsquo;s eyes grew round. &ldquo;It was a perfectly awful letter. Charles said it
      was the letter of a madman. In the end she had the pendant back again from
      the shop and threw it into the duck-pond.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did she give any reasons?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We think she meant to be invited to Oniton, and so climb into society.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s rather old for that,&rdquo; said Margaret pensively.
      &ldquo;May she not have given the present to Evie in remembrance of her mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a notion. Give every one their due, eh? Well, I suppose I ought to
      be toddling. Come along, Mr. Muff&mdash;you want a new coat, but I don&rsquo;t
      know who&rsquo;ll give it you, I&rsquo;m sure;&rdquo; and addressing her apparel with
      mournful humour, Dolly moved from the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret followed her to ask whether Henry knew about Miss Avery&rsquo;s
      rudeness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder, then, why he let me ask her to look after the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But she&rsquo;s only a farm woman,&rdquo; said Dolly, and her explanation proved
      correct. Henry only censured the lower classes when it suited him. He bore
      with Miss Avery as with Crane&mdash;because he could get good value out of
      them. &ldquo;I have patience with a man who knows his job,&rdquo; he would say, really
      having patience with the job, and not the man. Paradoxical as it may
      sound, he had something of the artist about him; he would pass over an
      insult to his daughter sooner than lose a good charwoman for his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret judged it better to settle the little trouble herself. Parties
      were evidently ruffled. With Henry&rsquo;s permission, she wrote a pleasant note
      to Miss Avery, asking her to leave the cases untouched. Then, at the first
      convenient opportunity, she went down herself, intending to repack her
      belongings and store them properly in the local warehouse; the plan had
      been amateurish and a failure. Tibby promised to accompany her, but at the
      last moment begged to be excused. So, for the second time in her life, she
      entered the house alone.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      The day of her visit was exquisite, and the last of unclouded happiness
      that she was to have for many months. Her anxiety about Helen&rsquo;s
      extraordinary absence was still dormant, and as for a possible brush with
      Miss Avery&mdash;that only gave zest to the expedition. She had also eluded
      Dolly&rsquo;s invitation to luncheon. Walking straight up from the station, she
      crossed the village green and entered the long chestnut avenue that
      connects it with the church. The church itself stood in the village once.
      But it there attracted so many worshippers that the devil, in a pet,
      snatched it from its foundations, and poised it on an inconvenient knoll,
      three quarters of a mile away. If this story is true, the chestnut avenue
      must have been planted by the angels. No more tempting approach could be
      imagined for the lukewarm Christian, and if he still finds the walk too
      long, the devil is defeated all the same, Science having built Holy
      Trinity, a Chapel of Ease, near the Charles&rsquo;s and roofed it with tin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up the avenue Margaret strolled slowly, stopping to watch the sky that
      gleamed through the upper branches of the chestnuts, or to finger the
      little horseshoes on the lower branches. Why has not England a great
      mythology? Our folklore has never advanced beyond daintiness, and the
      greater melodies about our country-side have all issued through the pipes
      of Greece. Deep and true as the native imagination can be, it seems to
      have failed here. It has stopped with the witches and the fairies. It
      cannot vivify one fraction of a summer field, or give names to half a
      dozen stars. England still waits for the supreme moment of her literature&mdash;for
      the great poet who shall voice her, or, better still for the thousand
      little poets whose voices shall pass into our common talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the church the scenery changed. The chestnut avenue opened into a road,
      smooth but narrow, which led into the untouched country. She followed it
      for over a mile. Its little hesitations pleased her. Having no urgent
      destiny, it strolled downhill or up as it wished, taking no trouble about
      the gradients, or about the view, which nevertheless expanded. The great
      estates that throttle the south of Hertfordshire were less obtrusive here,
      and the appearance of the land was neither aristocratic nor suburban. To
      define it was difficult, but Margaret knew what it was not: it was not
      snobbish. Though its contours were slight, there was a touch of freedom in
      their sweep to which Surrey will never attain, and the distant brow of the
      Chilterns towered like a mountain. &ldquo;Left to itself,&rdquo; was Margaret&rsquo;s
      opinion, &ldquo;this county would vote Liberal.&rdquo; The comradeship, not
      passionate, that is our highest gift as a nation, was promised by it, as
      by the low brick farm where she called for the key.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the inside of the farm was disappointing. A most finished young person
      received her. &ldquo;Yes, Mrs. Wilcox; no, Mrs. Wilcox; oh yes, Mrs. Wilcox,
      auntie received your letter quite duly. Auntie has gone up to your little
      place at the present moment. Shall I send the servant to direct you?&rdquo;
       Followed by: &ldquo;Of course, auntie does not generally look after your place;
      she only does it to oblige a neighbour as something exceptional. It gives
      her something to do. She spends quite a lot of her time there. My husband
      says to me sometimes, &lsquo;Where&rsquo;s auntie?&rsquo; I say, &lsquo;Need you ask? She&rsquo;s at
      Howards End.&rsquo; Yes, Mrs. Wilcox. Mrs. Wilcox, could I prevail upon you to
      accept a piece of cake? Not if I cut it for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret refused the cake, but unfortunately this gave her gentility in
      the eyes of Miss Avery&rsquo;s niece.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot let you go on alone. Now don&rsquo;t. You really mustn&rsquo;t. I will
      direct you myself if it comes to that. I must get my hat. Now&rdquo;&mdash;roguishly&mdash;&ldquo;Mrs.
      Wilcox, don&rsquo;t you move while I&rsquo;m gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Stunned, Margaret did not move from the best parlour, over which the touch
      of art nouveau had fallen. But the other rooms looked in keeping, though
      they conveyed the peculiar sadness of a rural interior. Here had lived an
      elder race, to which we look back with disquietude. The country which we
      visit at week-ends was really a home to it, and the graver sides of life,
      the deaths, the partings, the yearnings for love, have their deepest
      expression in the heart of the fields. All was not sadness. The sun was
      shining without. The thrush sang his two syllables on the budding
      guelder-rose. Some children were playing uproariously in heaps of golden
      straw. It was the presence of sadness at all that surprised Margaret, and
      ended by giving her a feeling of completeness. In these English farms, if
      anywhere, one might see life steadily and see it whole, group in one
      vision its transitoriness and its eternal youth, connect&mdash;connect
      without bitterness until all men are brothers. But her thoughts were
      interrupted by the return of Miss Avery&rsquo;s niece, and were so
      tranquillising that she suffered the interruption gladly.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was quicker to go out by the back door, and, after due explanations,
      they went out by it. The niece was now mortified by innumerable chickens,
      who rushed up to her feet for food, and by a shameless and maternal sow.
      She did not know what animals were coming to. But her gentility withered
      at the touch of the sweet air. The wind was rising, scattering the straw
      and ruffling the tails of the ducks as they floated in families over
      Evie&rsquo;s pendant. One of those delicious gales of spring, in which leaves
      still in bud seem to rustle, swept over the land and then fell silent.
      &ldquo;Georgie,&rdquo; sang the thrush. &ldquo;Cuckoo,&rdquo; came furtively from the cliff of
      pine-trees. &ldquo;Georgie, pretty Georgie,&rdquo; and the other birds joined in with
      nonsense. The hedge was a half-painted picture which would be finished in
      a few days. Celandines grew on its banks, lords and ladies and primroses
      in the defended hollows; the wild rose-bushes, still bearing their
      withered hips, showed also the promise of blossom. Spring had come, clad
      in no classical garb, yet fairer than all springs; fairer even than she
      who walks through the myrtles of Tuscany with the graces before her and
      the zephyr behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two women walked up the lane full of outward civility. But Margaret
      was thinking how difficult it was to be earnest about furniture on such a
      day, and the niece was thinking about hats. Thus engaged, they reached
      Howards End. Petulant cries of &ldquo;Auntie!&rdquo; severed the air. There was no
      reply, and the front door was locked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sure that Miss Avery is up here?&rdquo; asked Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, Mrs. Wilcox, quite sure. She is here daily.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret tried to look in through the dining-room window, but the curtain
      inside was drawn tightly. So with the drawing-room and the hall. The
      appearance of these curtains was familiar, yet she did not remember their
      being there on her other visit; her impression was that Mr. Bryce had
      taken everything away. They tried the back. Here again they received no
      answer, and could see nothing; the kitchen-window was fitted with a blind,
      while the pantry and scullery had pieces of wood propped up against them,
      which looked ominously like the lids of packing-cases. Margaret thought of
      her books, and she lifted up her voice also. At the first cry she
      succeeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well!&rdquo; replied some one inside the house. &ldquo;If it isn&rsquo;t Mrs. Wilcox
      come at last!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you got the key, auntie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madge, go away,&rdquo; said Miss Avery, still invisible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Auntie, it&rsquo;s Mrs. Wilcox&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret supported her. &ldquo;Your niece and I have come together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madge, go away. This is no moment for your hat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The poor woman went red. &ldquo;Auntie gets more eccentric lately,&rdquo; she said
      nervously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Avery!&rdquo; called Margaret. &ldquo;I have come about the furniture. Could you
      kindly let me in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Mrs. Wilcox,&rdquo; said the voice, &ldquo;of course.&rdquo; But after that came
      silence. They called again without response. They walked round the house
      disconsolately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope Miss Avery is not ill,&rdquo; hazarded Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if you&rsquo;ll excuse me,&rdquo; said Madge, &ldquo;perhaps I ought to be leaving
      you now. The servants need seeing to at the farm. Auntie is so odd at
      times.&rdquo; Gathering up her elegancies, she retired defeated, and, as if her
      departure had loosed a spring, the front door opened at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Avery said, &ldquo;Well, come right in, Mrs. Wilcox!&rdquo; quite pleasantly and
      calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you so much,&rdquo; began Margaret, but broke off at the sight of an
      umbrella-stand. It was her own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come right into the hall first,&rdquo; said Miss Avery. She drew the curtain,
      and Margaret uttered a cry of despair. For an appalling thing had
      happened. The hall was fitted up with the contents of the library from
      Wickham Place. The carpet had been laid, the big work-table drawn up near
      the window; the bookcases filled the wall opposite the fireplace, and her
      father&rsquo;s sword&mdash;this is what bewildered her particularly&mdash;had
      been drawn from its scabbard and hung naked amongst the sober volumes.
      Miss Avery must have worked for days.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid this isn&rsquo;t what we meant,&rdquo; she began. &ldquo;Mr. Wilcox and I never
      intended the cases to be touched. For instance, these books are my
      brother&rsquo;s. We are storing them for him and for my sister, who is abroad.
      When you kindly undertook to look after things, we never expected you to
      do so much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The house has been empty long enough,&rdquo; said the old woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret refused to argue. &ldquo;I dare say we didn&rsquo;t explain,&rdquo; she said
      civilly. &ldquo;It has been a mistake, and very likely our mistake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Wilcox, it has been mistake upon mistake for fifty years. The house
      is Mrs. Wilcox&rsquo;s, and she would not desire it to stand empty any longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To help the poor decaying brain, Margaret said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Mrs. Wilcox&rsquo;s house, the mother of Mr. Charles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mistake upon mistake,&rdquo; said Miss Avery. &ldquo;Mistake upon mistake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Margaret, sitting down in one of her own
      chairs. &ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s to be done.&rdquo; She could not help
      laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other said: &ldquo;Yes, it should be a merry house enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;I dare say. Well, thank you very much, Miss Avery.
      Yes, that&rsquo;s all right. Delightful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is still the parlour.&rdquo; She went through the door opposite and drew
      a curtain. Light flooded the drawing-room furniture from Wickham Place.
      &ldquo;And the dining-room.&rdquo; More curtains were drawn, more windows were flung
      open to the spring. &ldquo;Then through here&mdash;&rdquo; Miss Avery continued
      passing and reprising through the hall. Her voice was lost, but Margaret
      heard her pulling up the kitchen blind. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve not finished here yet,&rdquo; she
      announced, returning. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s still a deal to do. The farm lads will
      carry your great wardrobes upstairs, for there is no need to go into
      expense at Hilton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is all a mistake,&rdquo; repeated Margaret, feeling that she must put her
      foot down. &ldquo;A misunderstanding. Mr. Wilcox and I are not going to live at
      Howards End.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, indeed! On account of his hay fever?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have settled to build a new home for ourselves in Sussex, and part of
      this furniture&mdash;my part&mdash;will go down there presently.&rdquo; She
      looked at Miss Avery intently, trying to understand the kink in her brain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here was no maundering old woman. Her wrinkles were shrewd and humorous.
      She looked capable of scathing wit and also of high but unostentatious
      nobility. &ldquo;You think that you won&rsquo;t come back to live here, Mrs. Wilcox,
      but you will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That remains to be seen,&rdquo; said Margaret, smiling. &ldquo;We have no intention
      of doing so for the present. We happen to need a much larger house.
      Circumstances oblige us to give big parties. Of course, some day&mdash;one
      never knows, does one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Avery retorted: &ldquo;Some day! Tcha! tcha! Don&rsquo;t talk about some day. You
      are living here now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are living here, and have been for the last ten minutes, if you ask
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a senseless remark, but with a queer feeling of disloyalty Margaret
      rose from her chair. She felt that Henry had been obscurely censured. They
      went into the dining-room, where the sunlight poured in upon her mother&rsquo;s
      chiffonier, and upstairs, where many an old god peeped from a new niche.
      The furniture fitted extraordinarily well. In the central room&mdash;over
      the hall, the room that Helen had slept in four years ago&mdash;Miss Avery
      had placed Tibby&rsquo;s old bassinette.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The nursery,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret turned away without speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last everything was seen. The kitchen and lobby were still stacked with
      furniture and straw, but, as far as she could make out, nothing had been
      broken or scratched. A pathetic display of ingenuity! Then they took a
      friendly stroll in the garden. It had gone wild since her last visit. The
      gravel sweep was weedy, and grass had sprung up at the very jaws of the
      garage. And Evie&rsquo;s rockery was only bumps. Perhaps Evie was responsible
      for Miss Avery&rsquo;s oddness. But Margaret suspected that the cause lay
      deeper, and that the girl&rsquo;s silly letter had but loosed the irritation of
      years.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a beautiful meadow,&rdquo; she remarked. It was one of those open-air
      drawing-rooms that have been formed, hundreds of years ago, out of the
      smaller fields. So the boundary hedge zigzagged down the hill at right
      angles, and at the bottom there was a little green annex&mdash;a sort of
      powder-closet for the cows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, the maidy&rsquo;s well enough,&rdquo; said Miss Avery, &ldquo;for those, that is, who
      don&rsquo;t suffer from sneezing.&rdquo; And she cackled maliciously. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen
      Charlie Wilcox go out to my lads in hay time&mdash;oh, they ought to do
      this&mdash;they mustn&rsquo;t do that&mdash;he&rsquo;d learn them to be lads. And just
      then the tickling took him. He has it from his father, with other things.
      There&rsquo;s not one Wilcox that can stand up against a field in June&mdash;I
      laughed fit to burst while he was courting Ruth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My brother gets hay fever too,&rdquo; said Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This house lies too much on the land for them. Naturally, they were glad
      enough to slip in at first. But Wilcoxes are better than nothing, as I see
      you&rsquo;ve found.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They keep a place going, don&rsquo;t they? Yes, it is just that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They keep England going, it is my opinion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Miss Avery upset her by replying: &ldquo;Ay, they breed like rabbits. Well,
      well, it&rsquo;s a funny world. But He who made it knows what He wants in it, I
      suppose. If Mrs. Charlie is expecting her fourth, it isn&rsquo;t for us to
      repine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They breed and they also work,&rdquo; said Margaret, conscious of some
      invitation to disloyalty, which was echoed by the very breeze and by the
      songs of the birds. &ldquo;It certainly is a funny world, but so long as men
      like my husband and his sons govern it, I think it&rsquo;ll never be a bad one&mdash;never
      really bad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, better&rsquo;n nothing,&rdquo; said Miss Avery, and turned to the wych-elm.
    </p>
    <p>
      On their way back to the farm she spoke of her old friend much more
      clearly than before. In the house Margaret had wondered whether she quite
      distinguished the first wife from the second. Now she said: &ldquo;I never saw
      much of Ruth after her grandmother died, but we stayed civil. It was a
      very civil family. Old Mrs. Howard never spoke against anybody, nor let
      any one be turned away without food. Then it was never &lsquo;Trespassers will
      be prosecuted&rsquo; in their land, but would people please not come in? Mrs.
      Howard was never created to run a farm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had they no men to help them?&rdquo; Margaret asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Avery replied: &ldquo;Things went on until there were no men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Until Mr. Wilcox came along,&rdquo; corrected Margaret, anxious that her
      husband should receive his dues.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose so; but Ruth should have married a&mdash;no disrespect to you
      to say this, for I take it you were intended to get Wilcox any way,
      whether she got him first or no.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whom should she have married?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A soldier!&rdquo; exclaimed the old woman. &ldquo;Some real soldier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret was silent. It was a criticism of Henry&rsquo;s character far more
      trenchant than any of her own. She felt dissatisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s all over,&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;A better time is coming now, though
      you&rsquo;ve kept me long enough waiting. In a couple of weeks I&rsquo;ll see your
      light shining through the hedge of an evening. Have you ordered in coals?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are not coming,&rdquo; said Margaret firmly. She respected Miss Avery too
      much to humour her. &ldquo;No. Not coming. Never coming. It has all been a
      mistake. The furniture must be repacked at once, and I am very sorry, but
      I am making other arrangements, and must ask you to give me the keys.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, Mrs. Wilcox,&rdquo; said Miss Avery, and resigned her duties with a
      smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Relieved at this conclusion, and having sent her compliments to Madge,
      Margaret walked back to the station. She had intended to go to the
      furniture warehouse and give directions for removal, but the muddle had
      turned out more extensive than she expected, so she decided to consult
      Henry. It was as well that she did this. He was strongly against employing
      the local man whom he had previously recommended, and advised her to store
      in London after all.
    </p>
    <p>
      But before this could be done an unexpected trouble fell upon her.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXIV
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was not unexpected entirely. Aunt Juley&rsquo;s health had been bad all
      winter. She had had a long series of colds and coughs, and had been too
      busy to get rid of them. She had scarcely promised her niece &ldquo;to really
      take my tiresome chest in hand,&rdquo; when she caught a chill and developed
      acute pneumonia. Margaret and Tibby went down to Swanage. Helen was
      telegraphed for, and that spring party that after all gathered in that
      hospitable house had all the pathos of fair memories. On a perfect day,
      when the sky seemed blue porcelain, and the waves of the discreet little
      bay beat gentlest of tattoos upon the sand, Margaret hurried up through
      the rhododendrons, confronted again by the senselessness of Death. One
      death may explain itself, but it throws no light upon another; the groping
      inquiry must begin anew. Preachers or scientists may generalise, but we
      know that no generality is possible about those whom we love; not one
      heaven awaits them, not even one oblivion. Aunt Juley, incapable of
      tragedy, slipped out of life with odd little laughs and apologies for
      having stopped in it so long. She was very weak; she could not rise to the
      occasion, or realise the great mystery which all agree must await her; it
      only seemed to her that she was quite done up&mdash;more done up than ever
      before; that she saw and heard and felt less every moment; and that,
      unless something changed, she would soon feel nothing. Her spare strength
      she devoted to plans: could not Margaret take some steamer expeditions?
      were mackerel cooked as Tibby liked them? She worried herself about
      Helen&rsquo;s absence, and also that she should be the cause of Helen&rsquo;s return.
      The nurses seemed to think such interests quite natural, and perhaps hers
      was an average approach to the Great Gate. But Margaret saw Death stripped
      of any false romance; whatever the idea of Death may contain, the process
      can be trivial and hideous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Important&mdash;Margaret dear, take the Lulworth when Helen comes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Helen won&rsquo;t be able to stop, Aunt Juley. She has telegraphed that she can
      only get away just to see you. She must go back to Germany as soon as you
      are well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How very odd of Helen! Mr. Wilcox&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can he spare you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Henry wished her to come, and had been very kind. Yet again Margaret said
      so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Munt did not die. Quite outside her will, a more dignified power took
      hold of her and checked her on the downward slope. She returned, without
      emotion, as fidgety as ever. On the fourth day she was out of danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Margaret&mdash;important,&rdquo; it went on: &ldquo;I should like you to have some
      companion to take walks with. Do try Miss Conder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been for a little walk with Miss Conder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But she is not really interesting. If only you had Helen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have Tibby, Aunt Juley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but he has to do his Chinese. Some real companion is what you need.
      Really, Helen is odd.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Helen is odd, very,&rdquo; agreed Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not content with going abroad, why does she want to go back there at
      once?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt she will change her mind when she sees us. She has not the least
      balance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was the stock criticism about Helen, but Margaret&rsquo;s voice trembled as
      she made it. By now she was deeply pained at her sister&rsquo;s behaviour. It
      may be unbalanced to fly out of England, but to stay away eight months
      argues that the heart is awry as well as the head. A sick-bed could recall
      Helen, but she was deaf to more human calls; after a glimpse at her aunt,
      she would retire into her nebulous life behind some poste restante. She
      scarcely existed; her letters had become dull and infrequent; she had no
      wants and no curiosity. And it was all put down to poor Henry&rsquo;s account!
      Henry, long pardoned by his wife, was still too infamous to be greeted by
      his sister-in-law. It was morbid, and, to her alarm, Margaret fancied that
      she could trace the growth of morbidity back in Helen&rsquo;s life for nearly
      four years. The flight from Oniton; the unbalanced patronage of the Basts;
      the explosion of grief up on the Downs&mdash;all connected with Paul, an
      insignificant boy whose lips had kissed hers for a fraction of time.
      Margaret and Mrs. Wilcox had feared that they might kiss again. Foolishly&mdash;the
      real danger was reaction. Reaction against the Wilcoxes had eaten into her
      life until she was scarcely sane. At twenty-five she had an idee fixe.
      What hope was there for her as an old woman?
    </p>
    <p>
      The more Margaret thought about it the more alarmed she became. For many
      months she had put the subject away, but it was too big to be slighted
      now. There was almost a taint of madness. Were all Helen&rsquo;s actions to be
      governed by a tiny mishap, such as may happen to any young man or woman?
      Can human nature be constructed on lines so insignificant? The blundering
      little encounter at Howards End was vital. It propagated itself where
      graver intercourse lay barren; it was stronger than sisterly intimacy,
      stronger than reason or books. In one of her moods Helen had confessed
      that she still &ldquo;enjoyed&rdquo; it in a certain sense. Paul had faded, but the
      magic of his caress endured. And where there is enjoyment of the past
      there may also be reaction&mdash;propagation at both ends.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, it is odd and sad that our minds should be such seed-beds, and we
      without power to choose the seed. But man is an odd, sad creature as yet,
      intent on pilfering the earth, and heedless of the growths within himself.
      He cannot be bored about psychology. He leaves it to the specialist, which
      is as if he should leave his dinner to be eaten by a steam-engine. He
      cannot be bothered to digest his own soul. Margaret and Helen have been
      more patient, and it is suggested that Margaret has succeeded&mdash;so far
      as success is yet possible. She does understand herself, she has some
      rudimentary control over her own growth. Whether Helen has succeeded one
      cannot say.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day that Mrs. Munt rallied Helen&rsquo;s letter arrived. She had posted it
      at Munich, and would be in London herself on the morrow. It was a
      disquieting letter, though the opening was affectionate and sane.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;DEAREST MEG,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give Helen&rsquo;s love to Aunt Juley. Tell her that I love, and have loved her
      ever since I can remember. I shall be in London Thursday.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My address will be care of the bankers. I have not yet settled on a
      hotel, so write or wire to me there and give me detailed news. If Aunt
      Juley is much better, or if, for a terrible reason, it would be no good my
      coming down to Swanage, you must not think it odd if I do not come. I have
      all sorts of plans in my head. I am living abroad at present, and want to
      get back as quickly as possible. Will you please tell me where our
      furniture is? I should like to take out one or two books; the rest are for
      you.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me, dearest Meg. This must read like rather a tiresome letter,
      but all letters are from your loving
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;HELEN.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a tiresome letter, for it tempted Margaret to tell a lie. If she
      wrote that Aunt Juley was still in danger her sister would come.
      Unhealthiness is contagious. We cannot be in contact with those who are in
      a morbid state without ourselves deteriorating. To &ldquo;act for the best&rdquo;
       might do Helen good, but would do herself harm, and, at the risk of
      disaster, she kept her colours flying a little longer. She replied that
      their aunt was much better, and awaited developments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tibby approved of her reply. Mellowing rapidly, he was a pleasanter
      companion than before. Oxford had done much for him. He had lost his
      peevishness, and could hide his indifference to people and his interest in
      food. But he had not grown more human. The years between eighteen and
      twenty-two, so magical for most, were leading him gently from boyhood to
      middle age. He had never known young-manliness, that quality which warms
      the heart till death, and gives Mr. Wilcox an imperishable charm. He was
      frigid, through no fault of his own, and without cruelty. He thought Helen
      wrong and Margaret right, but the family trouble was for him what a scene
      behind footlights is for most people. He had only one suggestion to make,
      and that was characteristic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you tell Mr. Wilcox?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About Helen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps he has come across that sort of thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He would do all he could, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you know best. But he is practical.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the student&rsquo;s belief in experts. Margaret demurred for one or two
      reasons. Presently Helen&rsquo;s answer came. She sent a telegram requesting the
      address of the furniture, as she would now return at once. Margaret
      replied, &ldquo;Certainly not; meet me at the bankers&rsquo; at four.&rdquo; She and Tibby
      went up to London. Helen was not at the bankers&rsquo;, and they were refused
      her address. Helen had passed into chaos.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret put her arm round her brother. He was all that she had left, and
      never had he seemed more unsubstantial.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tibby love, what next?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He replied: &ldquo;It is extraordinary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear, your judgment&rsquo;s often clearer than mine. Have you any notion what&rsquo;s
      at the back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None, unless it&rsquo;s something mental.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;that!&rdquo; said Margaret. &ldquo;Quite impossible.&rdquo; But the suggestion had
      been uttered, and in a few minutes she took it up herself. Nothing else
      explained. And London agreed with Tibby. The mask fell off the city, and
      she saw it for what it really is&mdash;a caricature of infinity. The
      familiar barriers, the streets along which she moved, the houses between
      which she had made her little journeys for so many years, became
      negligible suddenly. Helen seemed one with grimy trees and the traffic and
      the slowly-flowing slabs of mud. She had accomplished a hideous act of
      renunciation and returned to the One. Margaret&rsquo;s own faith held firm. She
      knew the human soul will be merged, if it be merged at all, with the stars
      and the sea. Yet she felt that her sister had been going amiss for many
      years. It was symbolic the catastrophe should come now, on a London
      afternoon, while rain fell slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry was the only hope. Henry was definite. He might know of some paths
      in the chaos that were hidden from them, and she determined to take
      Tibby&rsquo;s advice and lay the whole matter in his hands. They must call at
      his office. He could not well make it worse. She went for a few moments
      into St. Paul&rsquo;s, whose dome stands out of the welter so bravely, as if
      preaching the gospel of form. But within, St. Paul&rsquo;s is as its
      surroundings&mdash;echoes and whispers, inaudible songs, invisible
      mosaics, wet footmarks, crossing and recrossing the floor. Si monumentum
      requiris, circumspice; it points us back to London. There was no hope of
      Helen here.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry was unsatisfactory at first. That she had expected. He was overjoyed
      to see her back from Swanage, and slow to admit the growth of a new
      trouble. When they told him of their search, he only chaffed Tibby and the
      Schlegels generally, and declared that it was &ldquo;just like Helen&rdquo; to lead
      her relatives a dance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is what we all say,&rdquo; replied Margaret. &ldquo;But why should it be just
      like Helen? Why should she be allowed to be so queer, and to grow
      queerer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask me. I&rsquo;m a plain man of business. I live and let live. My advice
      to you both is, don&rsquo;t worry. Margaret, you&rsquo;ve got black marks again under
      your eyes. You know that&rsquo;s strictly forbidden. First your aunt&mdash;then
      your sister. No, we aren&rsquo;t going to have it. Are we, Theobald?&rdquo; He rang
      the bell. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you some tea, and then you go straight to Ducie
      Street. I can&rsquo;t have my girl looking as old as her husband.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the same, you have not quite seen our point,&rdquo; said Tibby.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wilcox, who was in good spirits, retorted, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose I ever
      shall.&rdquo; He leant back, laughing at the gifted but ridiculous family, while
      the fire flickered over the map of Africa. Margaret motioned to her
      brother to go on. Rather diffident, he obeyed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Margaret&rsquo;s point is this,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Our sister may be mad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Charles, who was working in the inner room, looked round.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in, Charles,&rdquo; said Margaret kindly. &ldquo;Could you help us at all? We
      are again in trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I cannot. What are the facts? We are all mad more or less, you
      know, in these days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The facts are as follows,&rdquo; replied Tibby, who had at times a pedantic
      lucidity. &ldquo;The facts are that she has been in England for three days and
      will not see us. She has forbidden the bankers to give us her address. She
      refuses to answer questions. Margaret finds her letters colourless. There
      are other facts, but these are the most striking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has never behaved like this before, then?&rdquo; asked Henry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not!&rdquo; said his wife, with a frown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my dear, how am I to know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A senseless spasm of annoyance came over her. &ldquo;You know quite well that
      Helen never sins against affection,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You must have noticed that
      much in her, surely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes; she and I have always hit it off together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Henry&mdash;can&rsquo;t you see?&mdash;I don&rsquo;t mean that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She recovered herself, but not before Charles had observed her. Stupid and
      attentive, he was watching the scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was meaning that when she was eccentric in the past, one could trace it
      back to the heart in the long-run. She behaved oddly because she cared for
      some one, or wanted to help them. There&rsquo;s no possible excuse for her now.
      She is grieving us deeply, and that is why I am sure that she is not well.
      &lsquo;Mad&rsquo; is too terrible a word, but she is not well. I shall never believe
      it. I shouldn&rsquo;t discuss my sister with you if I thought she was well&mdash;trouble
      you about her, I mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Henry began to grow serious. Ill-health was to him something perfectly
      definite. Generally well himself, he could not realise that we sink to it
      by slow gradations. The sick had no rights; they were outside the pale;
      one could lie to them remorselessly. When his first wife was seized, he
      had promised to take her down into Hertfordshire, but meanwhile arranged
      with a nursing-home instead. Helen, too, was ill. And the plan that he
      sketched out for her capture, clever and well-meaning as it was, drew its
      ethics from the wolf-pack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You want to get hold of her?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the problem, isn&rsquo;t it? She
      has got to see a doctor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For all I know she has seen one already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes; don&rsquo;t interrupt.&rdquo; He rose to his feet and thought intently. The
      genial, tentative host disappeared, and they saw instead the man who had
      carved money out of Greece and Africa, and bought forests from the natives
      for a few bottles of gin. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got it,&rdquo; he said at last. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s perfectly
      easy. Leave it to me. We&rsquo;ll send her down to Howards End.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How will you do that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After her books. Tell her that she must unpack them herself. Then you can
      meet her there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Henry, that&rsquo;s just what she won&rsquo;t let me do. It&rsquo;s part of her&mdash;whatever
      it is&mdash;never to see me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course you won&rsquo;t tell her you&rsquo;re going. When she is there, looking at
      the cases, you&rsquo;ll just stroll in. If nothing is wrong with her, so much
      the better. But there&rsquo;ll be the motor round the corner, and we can run her
      to a specialist in no time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret shook her head. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite impossible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t seem impossible to me,&rdquo; said Tibby; &ldquo;it is surely a very tippy
      plan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is impossible, because&mdash;&rdquo; She looked at her husband sadly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
      not the particular language that Helen and I talk, if you see my meaning.
      It would do splendidly for other people, whom I don&rsquo;t blame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Helen doesn&rsquo;t talk,&rdquo; said Tibby. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s our whole difficulty. She
      won&rsquo;t talk your particular language, and on that account you think she&rsquo;s
      ill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Henry; it&rsquo;s sweet of you, but I couldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;you have scruples.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And sooner than go against them you would have your sister suffer. You
      could have got her down to Swanage by a word, but you had scruples. And
      scruples are all very well. I am as scrupulous as any man alive, I hope;
      but when it is a case like this, when there is a question of madness&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I deny it&rsquo;s madness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said just now&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s madness when I say it, but not when you say it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Henry shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;Margaret! Margaret!&rdquo; he groaned. &ldquo;No
      education can teach a woman logic. Now, my dear, my time is valuable. Do
      you want me to help you or not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in that way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Answer my question. Plain question, plain answer. Do&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Charles surprised them by interrupting. &ldquo;Pater, we may as well keep
      Howards End out of it,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Charles?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Charles could give no reason; but Margaret felt as if, over tremendous
      distance, a salutation had passed between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The whole house is at sixes and sevens,&rdquo; he said crossly. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want
      any more mess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s &lsquo;we&rsquo;?&rdquo; asked his father. &ldquo;My boy, pray who&rsquo;s &lsquo;we&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure I beg your pardon,&rdquo; said Charles. &ldquo;I appear always to be
      intruding.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By now Margaret wished she had never mentioned her trouble to her husband.
      Retreat was impossible. He was determined to push the matter to a
      satisfactory conclusion, and Helen faded as he talked. Her fair, flying
      hair and eager eyes counted for nothing, for she was ill, without rights,
      and any of her friends might hunt her. Sick at heart, Margaret joined in
      the chase. She wrote her sister a lying letter, at her husband&rsquo;s
      dictation; she said the furniture was all at Howards End, but could be
      seen on Monday next at 3 P.M., when a charwoman would be in attendance. It
      was a cold letter, and the more plausible for that. Helen would think she
      was offended. And on Monday next she and Henry were to lunch with Dolly,
      and then ambush themselves in the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      After they had gone, Mr. Wilcox said to his son: &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t have this sort
      of behaviour, my boy. Margaret&rsquo;s too sweet-natured to mind, but I mind for
      her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Charles made no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is anything wrong with you, Charles, this afternoon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, pater; but you may be taking on a bigger business than you reckon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask me.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXV
    </h2>
    <p>
      One speaks of the moods of spring, but the days that are her true children
      have only one mood; they are all full of the rising and dropping of winds,
      and the whistling of birds. New flowers may come out, the green embroidery
      of the hedges increase, but the same heaven broods overhead, soft, thick,
      and blue, the same figures, seen and unseen, are wandering by coppice and
      meadow. The morning that Margaret had spent with Miss Avery, and the
      afternoon she set out to entrap Helen, were the scales of a single
      balance. Time might never have moved, rain never have fallen, and man
      alone, with his schemes and ailments, was troubling Nature until he saw
      her through a veil of tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      She protested no more. Whether Henry was right or wrong, he was most kind,
      and she knew of no other standard by which to judge him. She must trust
      him absolutely. As soon as he had taken up a business, his obtuseness
      vanished. He profited by the slightest indications, and the capture of
      Helen promised to be staged as deftly as the marriage of Evie.
    </p>
    <p>
      They went down in the morning as arranged, and he discovered that their
      victim was actually in Hilton. On his arrival he called at all the
      livery-stables in the village, and had a few minutes&rsquo; serious conversation
      with the proprietors. What he said, Margaret did not know&mdash;perhaps
      not the truth; but news arrived after lunch that a lady had come by the
      London train, and had taken a fly to Howards End.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was bound to drive,&rdquo; said Henry. &ldquo;There will be her books.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot make it out,&rdquo; said Margaret for the hundredth time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Finish your coffee, dear. We must be off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Margaret, you know you must take plenty,&rdquo; said Dolly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret tried, but suddenly lifted her hand to her eyes. Dolly stole
      glances at her father-in-law which he did not answer. In the silence the
      motor came round to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not fit for it,&rdquo; he said anxiously. &ldquo;Let me go alone. I know
      exactly what to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, I am fit,&rdquo; said Margaret, uncovering her face. &ldquo;Only most
      frightfully worried. I cannot feel that Helen is really alive. Her letters
      and telegrams seem to have come from some one else. Her voice isn&rsquo;t in
      them. I don&rsquo;t believe your driver really saw her at the station. I wish
      I&rsquo;d never mentioned it. I know that Charles is vexed. Yes, he is&mdash;&rdquo;
       She seized Dolly&rsquo;s hand and kissed it. &ldquo;There, Dolly will forgive me.
      There. Now we&rsquo;ll be off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Henry had been looking at her closely. He did not like this breakdown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want to tidy yourself?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have I time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, plenty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She went to the lavatory by the front door, and as soon as the bolt
      slipped, Mr. Wilcox said quietly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dolly, I&rsquo;m going without her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dolly&rsquo;s eyes lit up with vulgar excitement. She followed him on tiptoe out
      to the car.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell her I thought it best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Mr. Wilcox, I see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say anything you like. All right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The car started well, and with ordinary luck would have got away. But
      Porgly-woggles, who was playing in the garden, chose this moment to sit
      down in the middle of the path. Crane, in trying to pass him, ran one
      wheel over a bed of wallflowers. Dolly screamed. Margaret, hearing the
      noise, rushed out hatless, and was in time to jump on the footboard. She
      said not a single word; he was only treating her as she had treated Helen,
      and her rage at his dishonesty only helped to indicate what Helen would
      feel against them. She thought, &ldquo;I deserve it; I am punished for lowering
      my colours.&rdquo; And she accepted his apologies with a calmness that
      astonished him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I still consider you are not fit for it,&rdquo; he kept saying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I was not at lunch. But the whole thing is spread clearly before
      me now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was meaning to act for the best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just lend me your scarf, will you. This wind takes one&rsquo;s hair so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, dear girl. Are you all right now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look! My hands have stopped trembling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And have quite forgiven me? Then listen. Her cab should already have
      arrived at Howards End. (We&rsquo;re a little late, but no matter.) Our first
      move will be to send it down to wait at the farm, as, if possible, one
      doesn&rsquo;t want a scene before servants. A certain gentleman&rdquo;&mdash;he
      pointed at Crane&rsquo;s back&mdash;&ldquo;won&rsquo;t drive in, but will wait a little
      short of the front gate, behind the laurels. Have you still the keys of
      the house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, they aren&rsquo;t wanted. Do you remember how the house stands?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we don&rsquo;t find her in the porch, we can stroll round into the garden.
      Our object&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here they stopped to pick up the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was just saying to my wife, Mansbridge, that our main object is not to
      frighten Miss Schlegel. The house, as you know, is my property, so it
      should seem quite natural for us to be there. The trouble is evidently
      nervous&mdash;wouldn&rsquo;t you say so, Margaret?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor, a very young man, began to ask questions about Helen. Was she
      normal? Was there anything congenital or hereditary? Had anything occurred
      that was likely to alienate her from her family?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; answered Margaret, wondering what would have happened if she
      had added: &ldquo;Though she did resent my husband&rsquo;s immorality.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She always was highly strung,&rdquo; pursued Henry, leaning back in the car as
      it shot past the church. &ldquo;A tendency to spiritualism and those things,
      though nothing serious. Musical, literary, artistic, but I should say
      normal&mdash;a very charming girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret&rsquo;s anger and terror increased every moment. How dare these men
      label her sister! What horrors lay ahead! What impertinences that shelter
      under the name of science! The pack was turning on Helen, to deny her
      human rights, and it seemed to Margaret that all Schlegels were threatened
      with her. &ldquo;Were they normal?&rdquo; What a question to ask! And it is always
      those who know nothing about human nature, who are bored by psychology&mdash;and
      shocked by physiology, who ask it. However piteous her sister&rsquo;s state, she
      knew that she must be on her side. They would be mad together if the world
      chose to consider them so.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was now five minutes past three. The car slowed down by the farm, in
      the yard of which Miss Avery was standing. Henry asked her whether a cab
      had gone past. She nodded, and the next moment they caught sight of it, at
      the end of the lane. The car ran silently like a beast of prey. So
      unsuspicious was Helen that she was sitting in the porch, with her back to
      the road. She had come. Only her head and shoulders were visible. She sat
      framed in the vine, and one of her hands played with the buds. The wind
      ruffled her hair, the sun glorified it; she was as she had always been.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret was seated next to the door. Before her husband could prevent
      her, she slipped out. She ran to the garden gate, which was shut, passed
      through it, and deliberately pushed it in his face. The noise alarmed
      Helen. Margaret saw her rise with an unfamiliar movement, and, rushing
      into the porch, learnt the simple explanation of all their fears&mdash;her
      sister was with child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the truant all right?&rdquo; called Henry.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had time to whisper: &ldquo;Oh, my darling&mdash;&rdquo; The keys of the house
      were in her hand. She unlocked Howards End and thrust Helen into it. &ldquo;Yes,
      all right,&rdquo; she said, and stood with her back to the door.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXVI
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Margaret, you look upset!&rdquo; said Henry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mansbridge had followed. Crane was at the gate, and the flyman had stood
      up on the box. Margaret shook her head at them; she could not speak any
      more. She remained clutching the keys, as if all their future depended on
      them. Henry was asking more questions. She shook her head again. His words
      had no sense. She heard him wonder why she had let Helen in. &ldquo;You might
      have given me a knock with the gate,&rdquo; was another of his remarks.
      Presently she heard herself speaking. She, or someone for her, said, &ldquo;Go
      away.&rdquo; Henry came nearer. He repeated, &ldquo;Margaret, you look upset again. My
      dear, give me the keys. What are you doing with Helen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dearest, do go away, and I will manage it all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Manage what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stretched out his hand for the keys. She might have obeyed if it had
      not been for the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop that at least,&rdquo; she said piteously; the doctor had turned back, and
      was questioning the driver of Helen&rsquo;s cab. A new feeling came over her;
      she was fighting for women against men. She did not care about rights, but
      if men came into Howards End, it should be over her body.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, this is an odd beginning,&rdquo; said her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor came forward now, and whispered two words to Mr. Wilcox&mdash;the
      scandal was out. Sincerely horrified, Henry stood gazing at the earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot help it,&rdquo; said Margaret. &ldquo;Do wait. It&rsquo;s not my fault. Please all
      four of you go away now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now the flyman was whispering to Crane.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are relying on you to help us, Mrs. Wilcox,&rdquo; said the young doctor.
      &ldquo;Could you go in and persuade your sister to come out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On what grounds?&rdquo; said Margaret, suddenly looking him straight in the
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thinking it professional to prevaricate, he murmured something about a
      nervous breakdown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon, but it is nothing of the sort. You are not qualified
      to attend my sister, Mr. Mansbridge. If we require your services, we will
      let you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can diagnose the case more bluntly if you wish,&rdquo; he retorted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You could, but you have not. You are, therefore, not qualified to attend
      my sister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come, Margaret!&rdquo; said Henry, never raising his eyes. &ldquo;This is a
      terrible business, an appalling business. It&rsquo;s doctor&rsquo;s orders. Open the
      door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me, but I will not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t agree.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This business is as broad as it&rsquo;s long,&rdquo; contributed the doctor. &ldquo;We had
      better all work together. You need us, Mrs. Wilcox, and we need you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so,&rdquo; said Henry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not need you in the least,&rdquo; said Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two men looked at each other anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No more does my sister, who is still many weeks from her confinement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Margaret, Margaret!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Henry, send your doctor away. What possible use is he now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wilcox ran his eye over the house. He had a vague feeling that he must
      stand firm and support the doctor. He himself might need support, for
      there was trouble ahead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It all turns on affection now,&rdquo; said Margaret. &ldquo;Affection. Don&rsquo;t you
      see?&rdquo; Resuming her usual methods, she wrote the word on the house with her
      finger. &ldquo;Surely you see. I like Helen very much, you not so much. Mr.
      Mansbridge doesn&rsquo;t know her. That&rsquo;s all. And affection, when reciprocated,
      gives rights. Put that down in your note-book, Mr. Mansbridge. It&rsquo;s a
      useful formula.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Henry told her to be calm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know what you want yourselves,&rdquo; said Margaret, folding her
      arms. &ldquo;For one sensible remark I will let you in. But you cannot make it.
      You would trouble my sister for no reason. I will not permit it. I&rsquo;ll
      stand here all the day sooner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mansbridge,&rdquo; said Henry in a low voice, &ldquo;perhaps not now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The pack was breaking up. At a sign from his master, Crane also went back
      into the car.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Henry, you,&rdquo; she said gently. None of her bitterness had been
      directed at him. &ldquo;Go away now, dear. I shall want your advice later, no
      doubt. Forgive me if I have been cross. But, seriously, you must go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was too stupid to leave her. Now it was Mr. Mansbridge who called in a
      low voice to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall soon find you down at Dolly&rsquo;s,&rdquo; she called, as the gate at last
      clanged between them. The fly moved out of the way, the motor backed,
      turned a little, backed again, and turned in the narrow road. A string of
      farm carts came up in the middle; but she waited through all, for there
      was no hurry. When all was over and the car had started, she opened the
      door. &ldquo;Oh, my darling!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;My darling, forgive me.&rdquo; Helen was
      standing in the hall.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXVII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Margaret bolted the door on the inside. Then she would have kissed her
      sister, but Helen, in a dignified voice, that came strangely from her,
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Convenient! You did not tell me that the books were unpacked. I have
      found nearly everything that I want.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you nothing that was true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has been a great surprise, certainly. Has Aunt Juley been ill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Helen, you wouldn&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d invent that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose not,&rdquo; said Helen, turning away, and crying a very little. &ldquo;But
      one loses faith in everything after this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We thought it was illness, but even then&mdash;I haven&rsquo;t behaved
      worthily.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen selected another book.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ought not to have consulted any one. What would our father have thought
      of me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not think of questioning her sister, or of rebuking her. Both
      might be necessary in the future, but she had first to purge a greater
      crime than any that Helen could have committed&mdash;that want of
      confidence that is the work of the devil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I am annoyed,&rdquo; replied Helen. &ldquo;My wishes should have been respected.
      I would have gone through this meeting if it was necessary, but after Aunt
      Juley recovered, it was not necessary. Planning my life, as I now have to
      do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come away from those books,&rdquo; called Margaret. &ldquo;Helen, do talk to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was just saying that I have stopped living haphazard. One can&rsquo;t go
      through a great deal of &mdash;&rdquo;&mdash;she left out the noun&mdash;&ldquo;without
      planning one&rsquo;s actions in advance. I am going to have a child in June, and
      in the first place conversations, discussions, excitement, are not good
      for me. I will go through them if necessary, but only then. In the second
      place I have no right to trouble people. I cannot fit in with England as I
      know it. I have done something that the English never pardon. It would not
      be right for them to pardon it. So I must live where I am not known.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why didn&rsquo;t you tell me, dearest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Helen judicially. &ldquo;I might have, but decided to wait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe you would never have told me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, I should. We have taken a flat in Munich.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret glanced out of the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By &lsquo;we&rsquo; I mean myself and Monica. But for her, I am and have been and
      always wish to be alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not heard of Monica.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t have. She&rsquo;s an Italian&mdash;by birth at least. She makes
      her living by journalism. I met her originally on Garda. Monica is much
      the best person to see me through.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very fond of her, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has been extraordinarily sensible with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret guessed at Monica&rsquo;s type&mdash;&ldquo;Italiano Inglesiato&rdquo; they had
      named it&mdash;the crude feminist of the South, whom one respects but
      avoids. And Helen had turned to it in her need!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must not think that we shall never meet,&rdquo; said Helen, with a measured
      kindness. &ldquo;I shall always have a room for you when you can be spared, and
      the longer you can be with me the better. But you haven&rsquo;t understood yet,
      Meg, and of course it is very difficult for you. This is a shock to you.
      It isn&rsquo;t to me, who have been thinking over our futures for many months,
      and they won&rsquo;t be changed by a slight contretemps, such as this. I cannot
      live in England.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Helen, you&rsquo;ve not forgiven me for my treachery. You COULDN&rsquo;T talk like
      this to me if you had.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Meg dear, why do we talk at all?&rdquo; She dropped a book and sighed
      wearily. Then, recovering herself, she said: &ldquo;Tell me, how is it that all
      the books are down here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Series of mistakes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And a great deal of furniture has been unpacked.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who lives here, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you are letting it, though.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The house is dead,&rdquo; said Margaret, with a frown. &ldquo;Why worry on about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I am interested. You talk as if I had lost all my interest in life. I
      am still Helen, I hope. Now this hasn&rsquo;t the feel of a dead house. The hall
      seems more alive even than in the old days, when it held the Wilcoxes&rsquo; own
      things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Interested, are you? Very well, I must tell you, I suppose. My husband
      lent it on condition we&mdash;but by a mistake all our things were
      unpacked, and Miss Avery, instead of&mdash;&rdquo; She stopped. &ldquo;Look here, I
      can&rsquo;t go on like this. I warn you I won&rsquo;t. Helen, why should you be so
      miserably unkind to me, simply because you hate Henry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t hate him now,&rdquo; said Helen. &ldquo;I have stopped being a schoolgirl,
      and, Meg, once again, I&rsquo;m not being unkind. But as for fitting in with
      your English life&mdash;no, put it out of your head at once. Imagine a
      visit from me at Ducie Street! It&rsquo;s unthinkable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret could not contradict her. It was appalling to see her quietly
      moving forward with her plans, not bitter or excitable, neither asserting
      innocence nor confessing guilt, merely desiring freedom and the company of
      those who would not blame her. She had been through&mdash;how much?
      Margaret did not know. But it was enough to part her from old habits as
      well as old friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me about yourself,&rdquo; said Helen, who had chosen her books, and was
      lingering over the furniture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing to tell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But your marriage has been happy, Meg?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but I don&rsquo;t feel inclined to talk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You feel as I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not that, but I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No more can I. It is a nuisance, but no good trying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Something had come between them. Perhaps it was Society, which
      henceforward would exclude Helen. Perhaps it was a third life, already
      potent as a spirit. They could find no meeting-place. Both suffered
      acutely, and were not comforted by the knowledge that affection survived.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Meg, is the coast clear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean that you want to go away from me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose so&mdash;dear old lady! it isn&rsquo;t any use. I knew we should have
      nothing to say. Give my love to Aunt Juley and Tibby, and take more
      yourself than I can say. Promise to come and see me in Munich later.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, dearest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For that is all we can do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It seemed so. Most ghastly of all was Helen&rsquo;s common sense; Monica had
      been extraordinarily good for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad to have seen you and the things.&rdquo; She looked at the bookcase
      lovingly, as if she was saying farewell to the past.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret unbolted the door. She remarked: &ldquo;The car has gone, and here&rsquo;s
      your cab.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She led the way to it, glancing at the leaves and the sky. The spring had
      never seemed more beautiful. The driver, who was leaning on the gate,
      called out, &ldquo;Please, lady, a message,&rdquo; and handed her Henry&rsquo;s
      visiting-card through the bars.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did this come?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crane had returned with it almost at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      She read the card with annoyance. It was covered with instructions in
      domestic French. When she and her sister had talked she was to come back
      for the night to Dolly&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Il faut dormir sur ce sujet.&rdquo; while Helen was
      to be found une comfortable chambre a l&rsquo;hotel. The final sentence
      displeased her greatly until she remembered that the Charles&rsquo;s had only
      one spare room, and so could not invite a third guest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Henry would have done what he could,&rdquo; she interpreted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen had not followed her into the garden. The door once open, she lost
      her inclination to fly. She remained in the hall, going from bookcase to
      table. She grew more like the old Helen, irresponsible and charming.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This IS Mr. Wilcox&rsquo;s house?&rdquo; she inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely you remember Howards End?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remember? I who remember everything! But it looks to be ours now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Avery was extraordinary,&rdquo; said Margaret, her own spirits lightening
      a little. Again she was invaded by a slight feeling of disloyalty. But it
      brought her relief, and she yielded to it. &ldquo;She loved Mrs. Wilcox, and
      would rather furnish her home with our things than think of it empty. In
      consequence here are all the library books.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not all the books. She hasn&rsquo;t unpacked the Art books, in which she may
      show her sense. And we never used to have the sword here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sword looks well, though.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Magnificent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the piano, Meg?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I warehoused that in London. Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Curious, too, that the carpet fits.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The carpet&rsquo;s a mistake,&rdquo; announced Helen. &ldquo;I know that we had it in
      London, but this floor ought to be bare. It is far too beautiful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You still have a mania for under-furnishing. Would you care to come into
      the dining-room before you start? There&rsquo;s no carpet there.&rdquo;
      </p>
     <p>     
      They went in, and each minute their talk became more natural.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, WHAT a place for mother&rsquo;s chiffonier!&rdquo; cried Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at the chairs, though.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, look at them! Wickham Place faced north, didn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;North-west.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anyhow, it is thirty years since any of those chairs have felt the sun.
      Feel. Their dear little backs are quite warm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why has Miss Avery made them set to partners? I shall just&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Over here, Meg. Put it so that any one sitting will see the lawn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret moved a chair. Helen sat down in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye&mdash;es. The window&rsquo;s too high.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Try a drawing-room chair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t like the drawing-room so much. The beam has been
      match-boarded. It would have been so beautiful otherwise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Helen, what a memory you have for some things! You&rsquo;re perfectly right.
      It&rsquo;s a room that men have spoilt through trying to make it nice for women.
      Men don&rsquo;t know what we want&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And never will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t agree. In two thousand years they&rsquo;ll know. Look where Tibby spilt
      the soup.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Coffee. It was coffee surely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen shook her head. &ldquo;Impossible. Tibby was far too young to be given
      coffee at that time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was father alive?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you&rsquo;re right and it must have been soup. I was thinking of much 
      later&mdash;that unsuccessful visit of Aunt Juley&rsquo;s, when she didn&rsquo;t realise
      that Tibby had grown up. It was coffee then, for he threw it down on purpose. There was
      some rhyme, &lsquo;Tea, coffee&mdash;coffee tea,&rsquo; that she said to him every
      morning at breakfast. Wait a minute&mdash;how did it go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know&mdash;no, I don&rsquo;t. What a detestable boy Tibby was!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the rhyme was simply awful. No decent person could put up with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, that greengage-tree,&rdquo; cried Helen, as if the garden was also part of
      their childhood. &ldquo;Why do I connect it with dumb-bells? And there come the
      chickens. The grass wants cutting. I love yellow-hammers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret interrupted her. &ldquo;I have got it,&rdquo; she announced.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
       &ldquo;&lsquo;Tea, tea, coffee, tea,
         Or chocolaritee.&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That every morning for three weeks. No wonder Tibby was wild.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tibby is moderately a dear now,&rdquo; said Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There! I knew you&rsquo;d say that in the end. Of course he&rsquo;s a dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A bell rang.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen! what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen said, &ldquo;Perhaps the Wilcoxes are beginning the siege.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What nonsense&mdash;listen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the triviality faded from their faces, though it left something behind&mdash;the
      knowledge that they never could be parted because their love was rooted in
      common things. Explanations and appeals had failed; they had tried for a
      common meeting-ground, and had only made each other unhappy. And all the
      time their salvation was lying round them&mdash;the past sanctifying the
      present; the present, with wild heart-throb, declaring that there would
      after all be a future with laughter and the voices of children. Helen,
      still smiling, came up to her sister. She said, &ldquo;It is always Meg.&rdquo; They
      looked into each other&rsquo;s eyes. The inner life had paid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Solemnly the clapper tolled. No one was in the front. Margaret went to the
      kitchen, and struggled between packing-cases to the window. Their visitor
      was only a little boy with a tin can. And triviality returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Little boy, what do you want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please, I am the milk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did Miss Avery send you?&rdquo; said Margaret, rather sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then take it back and say we require no milk.&rdquo; While she called to Helen,
      &ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s not the siege, but possibly an attempt to provision us against
      one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I like milk,&rdquo; cried Helen. &ldquo;Why send it away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you? Oh, very well. But we&rsquo;ve nothing to put it in, and he wants the
      can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please, I&rsquo;m to call in the morning for the can,&rdquo; said the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The house will be locked up then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the morning would I bring eggs too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you the boy whom I saw playing in the stacks last week?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The child hung his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, run away and do it again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nice little boy,&rdquo; whispered Helen. &ldquo;I say, what&rsquo;s your name? Mine&rsquo;s
      Helen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was Helen all over. The Wilcoxes, too, would ask a child its name,
      but they never told their names in return.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tom, this one here is Margaret. And at home we&rsquo;ve another called Tibby.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mine are lop-eareds,&rdquo; replied Tom, supposing Tibby to be a rabbit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a very good and rather a clever little boy. Mind you come again.&mdash;Isn&rsquo;t
      he charming?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Undoubtedly,&rdquo; said Margaret. &ldquo;He is probably the son of Madge, and Madge
      is dreadful. But this place has wonderful powers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I probably agree with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It kills what is dreadful and makes what is beautiful live.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do agree,&rdquo; said Helen, as she sipped the milk. &ldquo;But you said that the
      house was dead not half an hour ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meaning that I was dead. I felt it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, the house has a surer life than we, even if it was empty, and, as it
      is, I can&rsquo;t get over that for thirty years the sun has never shone full on
      our furniture. After all, Wickham Place was a grave. Meg, I&rsquo;ve a startling
      idea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drink some milk to steady you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret obeyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I won&rsquo;t tell you yet,&rdquo; said Helen, &ldquo;because you may laugh or be
      angry. Let&rsquo;s go upstairs first and give the rooms an airing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They opened window after window, till the inside, too, was rustling to the
      spring. Curtains blew, picture frames tapped cheerfully. Helen uttered
      cries of excitement as she found this bed obviously in its right place,
      that in its wrong one. She was angry with Miss Avery for not having moved
      the wardrobes up. &ldquo;Then one would see really.&rdquo; She admired the view. She
      was the Helen who had written the memorable letters four years ago. As
      they leant out, looking westward, she said: &ldquo;About my idea. Couldn&rsquo;t you
      and I camp out in this house for the night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we could well do that,&rdquo; said Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here are beds, tables, towels&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know; but the house isn&rsquo;t supposed to be slept in, and Henry&rsquo;s
      suggestion was&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I require no suggestions. I shall not alter anything in my plans. But it
      would give me so much pleasure to have one night here with you. It will be
      something to look back on. Oh, Meg lovey, do let&rsquo;s!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Helen, my pet,&rdquo; said Margaret, &ldquo;we can&rsquo;t without getting Henry&rsquo;s
      leave. Of course, he would give it, but you said yourself that you
      couldn&rsquo;t visit at Ducie Street now, and this is equally intimate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ducie Street is his house. This is ours. Our furniture, our sort of
      people coming to the door. Do let us camp out, just one night, and Tom
      shall feed us on eggs and milk. Why not? It&rsquo;s a moon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret hesitated. &ldquo;I feel Charles wouldn&rsquo;t like it,&rdquo; she said at last.
      &ldquo;Even our furniture annoyed him, and I was going to clear it out when Aunt
      Juley&rsquo;s illness prevented me. I sympathise with Charles. He feels it&rsquo;s his
      mother&rsquo;s house. He loves it in rather an untaking way. Henry I could
      answer for&mdash;not Charles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know he won&rsquo;t like it,&rdquo; said Helen. &ldquo;But I am going to pass out of
      their lives. What difference will it make in the long run if they say,
      &lsquo;And she even spent the night at Howards End&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know you&rsquo;ll pass out of their lives? We have thought that
      twice before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because my plans&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;which you change in a moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then because my life is great and theirs are little,&rdquo; said Helen, taking
      fire. &ldquo;I know of things they can&rsquo;t know of, and so do you. We know that
      there&rsquo;s poetry. We know that there&rsquo;s death. They can only take them on
      hearsay. We know this is our house, because it feels ours. Oh, they may
      take the title-deeds and the door-keys, but for this one night we are at
      home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be lovely to have you once more alone,&rdquo; said Margaret. &ldquo;It may
      be a chance in a thousand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and we could talk.&rdquo; She dropped her voice. &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be a very
      glorious story. But under that wych-elm&mdash;honestly, I see little
      happiness ahead. Cannot I have this one night with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I needn&rsquo;t say how much it would mean to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then let us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is no good hesitating. Shall I drive down to Hilton now and get
      leave?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, we don&rsquo;t want leave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Margaret was a loyal wife. In spite of imagination and poetry&mdash;perhaps
      on account of them&mdash;she could sympathise with the technical attitude
      that Henry would adopt. If possible, she would be technical, too. A
      night&rsquo;s lodging&mdash;and they demanded no more&mdash;need not involve the
      discussion of general principles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Charles may say no,&rdquo; grumbled Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shan&rsquo;t consult him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go if you like; I should have stopped without leave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the touch of selfishness, which was not enough to mar Helen&rsquo;s
      character, and even added to its beauty. She would have stopped without
      leave and escaped to Germany the next morning. Margaret kissed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Expect me back before dark. I am looking forward to it so much. It is
      like you to have thought of such a beautiful thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a thing, only an ending,&rdquo; said Helen rather sadly; and the sense of
      tragedy closed in on Margaret again as soon as she left the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was afraid of Miss Avery. It is disquieting to fulfil a prophecy,
      however superficially. She was glad to see no watching figure as she drove
      past the farm, but only little Tom, turning somersaults in the straw.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXVIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      The tragedy began quietly enough, and, like many another talk, by the
      man&rsquo;s deft assertion of his superiority. Henry heard her arguing with the
      driver, stepped out and settled the fellow, who was inclined to be rude,
      and then led the way to some chairs on the lawn. Dolly, who had not been
      &ldquo;told,&rdquo; ran out with offers of tea. He refused them, and ordered them to
      wheel baby&rsquo;s perambulator away, as they desired to be alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the diddums can&rsquo;t listen; he isn&rsquo;t nine months old,&rdquo; she pleaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not what I was saying,&rdquo; retorted her father-in-law.
    </p>
    <p>
      Baby was wheeled out of earshot, and did not hear about the crisis till
      later years. It was now the turn of Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it what we feared?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear girl,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;there is a troublesome business ahead of us, and
      nothing but the most absolute honesty and plain speech will see us
      through.&rdquo; Margaret bent her head. &ldquo;I am obliged to question you on
      subjects we&rsquo;d both prefer to leave untouched. As you know, I am not one of
      your Bernard Shaws who consider nothing sacred. To speak as I must will
      pain me, but there are occasions&mdash;We are husband and wife, not
      children. I am a man of the world, and you are a most exceptional woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All Margaret&rsquo;s senses forsook her. She blushed, and looked past him at the
      Six Hills, covered with spring herbage. Noting her colour, he grew still
      more kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see that you feel as I felt when&mdash;My poor little wife! Oh, be
      brave! Just one or two questions, and I have done with you. Was your
      sister wearing a wedding-ring?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret stammered a &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was an appalling silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Henry, I really came to ask a favour about Howards End.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One point at a time. I am now obliged to ask for the name of her
      seducer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She rose to her feet and held the chair between them. Her colour had
      ebbed, and she was grey. It did not displease him that she should receive
      his question thus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take your time,&rdquo; he counselled her. &ldquo;Remember that this is far worse for
      me than for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She swayed; he feared she was going to faint. Then speech came, and she
      said slowly: &ldquo;Seducer? No; I do not know her seducer&rsquo;s name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would she not tell you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never even asked her who seduced her,&rdquo; said Margaret, dwelling on the
      hateful word thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is singular.&rdquo; Then he changed his mind. &ldquo;Natural perhaps, dear girl,
      that you shouldn&rsquo;t ask. But until his name is known, nothing can be done.
      Sit down. How terrible it is to see you so upset! I knew you weren&rsquo;t fit
      for it. I wish I hadn&rsquo;t taken you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret answered, &ldquo;I like to stand, if you don&rsquo;t mind, for it gives me a
      pleasant view of the Six Hills.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you anything else to ask me, Henry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Next you must tell me whether you have gathered anything. I have often
      noticed your insight, dear. I only wish my own was as good. You may have
      guessed something, even though your sister said nothing. The slightest
      hint would help us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is &lsquo;we&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought it best to ring up Charles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was unnecessary,&rdquo; said Margaret, growing warmer. &ldquo;This news will
      give Charles disproportionate pain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has at once gone to call on your brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That too was unnecessary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me explain, dear, how the matter stands. You don&rsquo;t think that I and
      my son are other than gentlemen? It is in Helen&rsquo;s interests that we are
      acting. It is still not too late to save her name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Margaret hit out for the first time. &ldquo;Are we to make her seducer
      marry her?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If possible, yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Henry, suppose he turned out to be married already? One has heard of
      such cases.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case he must pay heavily for his misconduct, and be thrashed
      within an inch of his life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So her first blow missed. She was thankful of it. What had tempted her to
      imperil both of their lives. Henry&rsquo;s obtuseness had saved her as well as
      himself. Exhausted with anger, she sat down again, blinking at him as he
      told her as much as he thought fit. At last she said: &ldquo;May I ask you my
      question now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, my dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow Helen goes to Munich&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, possibly she is right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Henry, let a lady finish. To-morrow she goes; to-night, with your
      permission, she would like to sleep at Howards End.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the crisis of his life. Again she would have recalled the words as
      soon as they were uttered. She had not led up to them with sufficient
      care. She longed to warn him that they were far more important than he
      supposed. She saw him weighing them, as if they were a business
      proposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why Howards End?&rdquo; he said at last. &ldquo;Would she not be more comfortable, as
      I suggested, at the hotel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret hastened to give him reasons. &ldquo;It is an odd request, but you know
      what Helen is and what women in her state are.&rdquo; He frowned, and moved
      irritably. &ldquo;She has the idea that one night in your house would give her
      pleasure and do her good. I think she&rsquo;s right. Being one of those
      imaginative girls, the presence of all our books and furniture soothes
      her. This is a fact. It is the end of her girlhood. Her last words to me
      were, &lsquo;A beautiful ending.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She values the old furniture for sentimental reasons, in fact.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly. You have quite understood. It is her last hope of being with
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t agree there, my dear! Helen will have her share of the goods
      wherever she goes&mdash;possibly more than her share, for you are so fond
      of her that you&rsquo;d give her anything of yours that she fancies, wouldn&rsquo;t
      you? and I&rsquo;d raise no objection. I could understand it if it was her old
      home, because a home, or a house,&rdquo; he changed the word, designedly; he had
      thought of a telling point&mdash;&ldquo;because a house in which one has once
      lived becomes in a sort of way sacred, I don&rsquo;t know why. Associations and
      so on. Now Helen has no associations with Howards End, though I and
      Charles and Evie have. I do not see why she wants to stay the night there.
      She will only catch cold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave it that you don&rsquo;t see,&rdquo; cried Margaret. &ldquo;Call it fancy. But realise
      that fancy is a scientific fact. Helen is fanciful, and wants to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he surprised her&mdash;a rare occurrence. He shot an unexpected bolt.
      &ldquo;If she wants to sleep one night she may want to sleep two. We shall never
      get her out of the house, perhaps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said Margaret, with the precipice in sight. &ldquo;And suppose we don&rsquo;t
      get her out of the house? Would it matter? She would do no one any harm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again the irritated gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Henry,&rdquo; she panted, receding. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean that. We will only
      trouble Howards End for this one night. I take her to London to-morrow&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you intend to sleep in a damp house, too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She cannot be left alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s quite impossible! Madness. You must be here to meet Charles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have already told you that your message to Charles was unnecessary, and
      I have no desire to meet him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Margaret&mdash;my Margaret.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has this business to do with Charles? If it concerns me little, it
      concerns you less, and Charles not at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As the future owner of Howards End,&rdquo; said Mr. Wilcox arching his fingers,
      &ldquo;I should say that it did concern Charles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In what way? Will Helen&rsquo;s condition depreciate the property?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, you are forgetting yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you yourself recommended plain speaking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They looked at each other in amazement. The precipice was at their feet
      now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Helen commands my sympathy,&rdquo; said Henry. &ldquo;As your husband, I shall do all
      for her that I can, and I have no doubt that she will prove more sinned
      against than sinning. But I cannot treat her as if nothing has happened. I
      should be false to my position in society if I did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She controlled herself for the last time. &ldquo;No, let us go back to Helen&rsquo;s
      request,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It is unreasonable, but the request of an unhappy
      girl. Tomorrow she will go to Germany, and trouble society no longer.
      To-night she asks to sleep in your empty house&mdash;a house which you do
      not care about, and which you have not occupied for over a year. May she?
      Will you give my sister leave? Will you forgive her as you hope to be
      forgiven, and as you have actually been forgiven? Forgive her for one
      night only. That will be enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I have actually been forgiven&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind for the moment what I mean by that,&rdquo; said Margaret. &ldquo;Answer my
      question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps some hint of her meaning did dawn on him. If so, he blotted it
      out. Straight from his fortress he answered: &ldquo;I seem rather
      unaccommodating, but I have some experience of life, and know how one
      thing leads to another. I am afraid that your sister had better sleep at
      the hotel. I have my children and the memory of my dear wife to consider.
      I am sorry, but see that she leaves my house at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have mentioned Mrs. Wilcox.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A rare occurrence. In reply, may I mention Mrs. Bast?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have not been yourself all day,&rdquo; said Henry, and rose from his seat
      with face unmoved. Margaret rushed at him and seized both his hands. She
      was transfigured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not any more of this!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;You shall see the connection if it
      kills you, Henry! You have had a mistress&mdash;I forgave you. My sister
      has a lover&mdash;you drive her from the house. Do you see the connection?
      Stupid, hypocritical, cruel&mdash;oh, contemptible!&mdash;a man who
      insults his wife when she&rsquo;s alive and cants with her memory when she&rsquo;s
      dead. A man who ruins a woman for his pleasure, and casts her off to ruin
      other men. And gives bad financial advice, and then says he is not
      responsible. These men are you. You can&rsquo;t recognise them, because you
      cannot connect. I&rsquo;ve had enough of your unneeded kindness. I&rsquo;ve spoilt you
      long enough. All your life you have been spoiled. Mrs. Wilcox spoiled you.
      No one has ever told what you are&mdash;muddled, criminally muddled. Men
      like you use repentance as a blind, so don&rsquo;t repent. Only say to yourself,
      &lsquo;What Helen has done, I&rsquo;ve done.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The two cases are different,&rdquo; Henry stammered. His real retort was not
      quite ready. His brain was still in a whirl, and he wanted a little
      longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In what way different? You have betrayed Mrs. Wilcox, Helen only herself.
      You remain in society, Helen can&rsquo;t. You have had only pleasure, she may
      die. You have the insolence to talk to me of differences, Henry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oh, the uselessness of it! Henry&rsquo;s retort came.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I perceive you are attempting blackmail. It is scarcely a pretty weapon
      for a wife to use against her husband. My rule through life has been never
      to pay the least attention to threats, and I can only repeat what I said
      before: I do not give you and your sister leave to sleep at Howards End.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret loosed his hands. He went into the house, wiping first one and
      then the other on his handkerchief. For a little she stood looking at the
      Six Hills, tombs of warriors, breasts of the spring. Then she passed out
      into what was now the evening.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXIX
    </h2>
    <p>
      Charles and Tibby met at Ducie Street, where the latter was staying. Their
      interview was short and absurd. They had nothing in common but the English
      language, and tried by its help to express what neither of them
      understood. Charles saw in Helen the family foe. He had singled her out as
      the most dangerous of the Schlegels, and, angry as he was, looked forward
      to telling his wife how right he had been. His mind was made up at once;
      the girl must be got out of the way before she disgraced them farther. If
      occasion offered she might be married to a villain, or, possibly, to a
      fool. But this was a concession to morality, it formed no part of his main
      scheme. Honest and hearty was Charles&rsquo;s dislike, and the past spread
      itself out very clearly before him; hatred is a skilful compositor. As if
      they were heads in a note-book, he ran through all the incidents of the
      Schlegels&rsquo; campaign: the attempt to compromise his brother, his mother&rsquo;s
      legacy, his father&rsquo;s marriage, the introduction of the furniture, the
      unpacking of the same. He had not yet heard of the request to sleep at
      Howards End; that was to be their master-stroke and the opportunity for
      his. But he already felt that Howards End was the objective, and, though
      he disliked the house, was determined to defend it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tibby, on the other hand, had no opinions. He stood above the conventions:
      his sister had a right to do what she thought right. It is not difficult
      to stand above the conventions when we leave no hostages among them; men
      can always be more unconventional than women, and a bachelor of
      independent means need encounter no difficulties at all. Unlike Charles,
      Tibby had money enough; his ancestors had earned it for him, and if he
      shocked the people in one set of lodgings he had only to move into
      another. His was the leisure without sympathy&mdash;an attitude as fatal
      as the strenuous; a little cold culture may be raised on it, but no art.
      His sisters had seen the family danger, and had never forgotten to
      discount the gold islets that raised them from the sea. Tibby gave all the
      praise to himself, and so despised the struggling and the submerged.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hence the absurdity of the interview; the gulf between them was economic
      as well as spiritual. But several facts passed; Charles pressed for them
      with an impertinence that the undergraduate could not withstand. On what
      date had Helen gone abroad? To whom? (Charles was anxious to fasten the
      scandal on Germany.) Then, changing his tactics, he said roughly: &ldquo;I
      suppose you realise that you are your sister&rsquo;s protector?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In what sense?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If a man played about with my sister, I&rsquo;d send a bullet through him, but
      perhaps you don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mind very much,&rdquo; protested Tibby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who d&rsquo;ye suspect, then? Speak out man. One always suspects some one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one. I don&rsquo;t think so.&rdquo; Involuntarily he blushed. He had remembered
      the scene in his Oxford rooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are hiding something,&rdquo; said Charles. As interviews go, he got the
      best of this one. &ldquo;When you saw her last, did she mention any one&rsquo;s name?
      Yes or no!&rdquo; he thundered, so that Tibby started.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In my rooms she mentioned some friends, called the Basts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are the Basts?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;People&mdash;friends of hers at Evie&rsquo;s wedding.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember. But, by great Scott, I do! My aunt told me about some
      rag-tag. Was she full of them when you saw her? Is there a man? Did she
      speak of the man? Or&mdash;look here&mdash;have you had any dealings with
      him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tibby was silent. Without intending it, he had betrayed his sister&rsquo;s
      confidence; he was not enough interested in human life to see where things
      will lead to. He had a strong regard for honesty, and his word, once
      given, had always been kept up to now. He was deeply vexed, not only for
      the harm he had done Helen, but for the flaw he had discovered in his own
      equipment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see&mdash;you are in his confidence. They met at your rooms. Oh, what a
      family, what a family! God help the poor pater&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Tibby found himself alone.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XL
    </h2>
    <p>
      Leonard&mdash;he would figure at length in a newspaper report, but that
      evening he did not count for much. The foot of the tree was in shadow,
      since the moon was still hidden behind the house. But above, to right, to
      left, down the long meadow the moonlight was streaming. Leonard seemed not
      a man, but a cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps it was Helen&rsquo;s way of falling in love&mdash;a curious way to
      Margaret, whose agony and whose contempt of Henry were yet imprinted with
      his image. Helen forgot people. They were husks that had enclosed her
      emotion. She could pity, or sacrifice herself, or have instincts, but had
      she ever loved in the noblest way, where man and woman, having lost
      themselves in sex, desire to lose sex itself in comradeship?
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret wondered, but said no word of blame. This was Helen&rsquo;s evening.
      Troubles enough lay ahead of her&mdash;the loss of friends and of social
      advantages, the agony, the supreme agony, of motherhood, which is not even
      yet a matter of common knowledge. For the present let the moon shine
      brightly and the breezes of the spring blow gently, dying away from the
      gale of the day, and let the earth, that brings increase, bring peace. Not
      even to herself dare she blame Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      She could not assess her trespass by any moral code; it was everything or
      nothing. Morality can tell us that murder is worse than stealing, and
      group most sins in an order all must approve, but it cannot group Helen.
      The surer its pronouncements on this point, the surer may we be that
      morality is not speaking. Christ was evasive when they questioned Him. It
      is those that cannot connect who hasten to cast the first stone.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was Helen&rsquo;s evening&mdash;won at what cost, and not to be marred by
      the sorrows of others. Of her own tragedy Margaret never uttered a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One isolates,&rdquo; said Helen slowly. &ldquo;I isolated Mr. Wilcox from the other
      forces that were pulling Leonard downhill. Consequently, I was full of
      pity, and almost of revenge. For weeks I had blamed Mr. Wilcox only, and
      so, when your letters came&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I need never have written them,&rdquo; sighed Margaret. &ldquo;They never shielded
      Henry. How hopeless it is to tidy away the past, even for others!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not know that it was your own idea to dismiss the Basts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Looking back, that was wrong of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Looking back, darling, I know that it was right. It is right to save the
      man whom one loves. I am less enthusiastic about justice now. But we both
      thought you wrote at his dictation. It seemed the last touch of his
      callousness. Being very much wrought up by this time&mdash;and Mrs. Bast
      was upstairs. I had not seen her, and had talked for a long time to
      Leonard&mdash;I had snubbed him for no reason, and that should have warned
      me I was in danger. So when the notes came I wanted us to go to you for an
      explanation. He said that he guessed the explanation&mdash;he knew of it,
      and you mustn&rsquo;t know. I pressed him to tell me. He said no one must know;
      it was something to do with his wife. Right up to the end we were Mr. Bast
      and Miss Schlegel. I was going to tell him that he must be frank with me
      when I saw his eyes, and guessed that Mr. Wilcox had ruined him in two
      ways, not one. I drew him to me. I made him tell me. I felt very lonely
      myself. He is not to blame. He would have gone on worshipping me. I want
      never to see him again, though it sounds appalling. I wanted to give him
      money and feel finished. Oh, Meg, the little that is known about these
      things!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laid her face against the tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The little, too, that is known about growth! Both times it was
      loneliness, and the night, and panic afterwards. Did Leonard grow out of
      Paul?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret did not speak for a moment. So tired was she that her attention
      had actually wandered to the teeth&mdash;the teeth that had been thrust
      into the tree&rsquo;s bark to medicate it. From where she sat she could see them
      gleam. She had been trying to count them. &ldquo;Leonard is a better growth than
      madness,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I was afraid that you would react against Paul until
      you went over the verge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did react until I found poor Leonard. I am steady now. I shan&rsquo;t ever
      like your Henry, dearest Meg, or even speak kindly about him, but all that
      blinding hate is over. I shall never rave against Wilcoxes any more. I
      understand how you married him, and you will now be very happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret did not reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; repeated Helen, her voice growing more tender, &ldquo;I do at last
      understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Except Mrs. Wilcox, dearest, no one understands our little movements.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because in death&mdash;I agree.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not quite. I feel that you and I and Henry are only fragments of that
      woman&rsquo;s mind. She knows everything. She is everything. She is the house,
      and the tree that leans over it. People have their own deaths as well as
      their own lives, and even if there is nothing beyond death, we shall
      differ in our nothingness. I cannot believe that knowledge such as hers
      will perish with knowledge such as mine. She knew about realities. She
      knew when people were in love, though she was not in the room. I don&rsquo;t
      doubt that she knew when Henry deceived her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night, Mrs. Wilcox,&rdquo; called a voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, good-night, Miss Avery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should Miss Avery work for us?&rdquo; Helen murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, indeed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Avery crossed the lawn and merged into the hedge that divided it from
      the farm. An old gap, which Mr. Wilcox had filled up, had reappeared, and
      her track through the dew followed the path that he had turfed over, when
      he improved the garden and made it possible for games.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is not quite our house yet,&rdquo; said Helen. &ldquo;When Miss Avery called, I
      felt we are only a couple of tourists.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall be that everywhere, and for ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But affectionate tourists.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But tourists who pretend each hotel is their home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t pretend very long,&rdquo; said Helen. &ldquo;Sitting under this tree one
      forgets, but I know that to-morrow I shall see the moon rise out of
      Germany. Not all your goodness can alter the facts of the case. Unless you
      will come with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret thought for a moment. In the past year she had grown so fond of
      England that to leave it was a real grief. Yet what detained her? No doubt
      Henry would pardon her outburst, and go on blustering and muddling into a
      ripe old age. But what was the good? She had just as soon vanish from his
      mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you serious in asking me, Helen? Should I get on with your Monica?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would not, but I am serious in asking you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still, no more plans now. And no more reminiscences.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were silent for a little. It was Helen&rsquo;s evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      The present flowed by them like a stream. The tree rustled. It had made
      music before they were born, and would continue after their deaths, but
      its song was of the moment. The moment had passed. The tree rustled again.
      Their senses were sharpened, and they seemed to apprehend life. Life
      passed. The tree rustled again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sleep now,&rdquo; said Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      The peace of the country was entering into her. It has no commerce with
      memory, and little with hope. Least of all is it concerned with the hopes
      of the next five minutes. It is the peace of the present, which passes
      understanding. Its murmur came &ldquo;now,&rdquo; and &ldquo;now&rdquo; once more as they trod the
      gravel, and &ldquo;now,&rdquo; as the moonlight fell upon their father&rsquo;s sword. They
      passed upstairs, kissed, and amidst the endless iterations fell asleep.
      The house had enshadowed the tree at first, but as the moon rose higher
      the two disentangled, and were clear for a few moments at midnight.
      Margaret awoke and looked into the garden. How incomprehensible that
      Leonard Bast should have won her this night of peace! Was he also part of
      Mrs. Wilcox&rsquo;s mind?

    <p>
      Far different was Leonard&rsquo;s development. The months after Oniton, whatever
      minor troubles they might bring him, were all overshadowed by Remorse.
      When Helen looked back she could philosophise, or she could look into the
      future and plan for her child. But the father saw nothing beyond his own
      sin. Weeks afterwards, in the midst of other occupations, he would
      suddenly cry out, &ldquo;Brute&mdash;you brute, I couldn&rsquo;t have&mdash;&rdquo; and be
      rent into two people who held dialogues. Or brown rain would descend,
      blotting out faces and the sky. Even Jacky noticed the change in him. Most
      terrible were his sufferings when he awoke from sleep. Sometimes he was
      happy at first, but grew conscious of a burden hanging to him and weighing
      down his thoughts when they would move. Or little irons scorched his body.
      Or a sword stabbed him. He would sit at the edge of his bed, holding his
      heart and moaning, &ldquo;Oh what SHALL I do, whatever SHALL I do?&rdquo; Nothing
      brought ease. He could put distance between him and the trespass, but it
      grew in his soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remorse is not among the eternal verities. The Greeks were right to
      dethrone her. Her action is too capricious, as though the Erinyes selected
      for punishment only certain men and certain sins. And of all means to
      regeneration Remorse is surely the most wasteful. It cuts away healthy
      tissues with the poisoned. It is a knife that probes far deeper than the
      evil. Leonard was driven straight through its torments and emerged pure,
      but enfeebled&mdash;a better man, who would never lose control of himself
      again, but also a smaller man, who had less to control. Nor did purity
      mean peace. The use of the knife can become a habit as hard to shake off
      as passion itself, and Leonard continued to start with a cry out of
      dreams.
    </p>
    <p>
      He built up a situation that was far enough from the truth. It never
      occurred to him that Helen was to blame. He forgot the intensity of their
      talk, the charm that had been lent him by sincerity, the magic of Oniton
      under darkness and of the whispering river. Helen loved the absolute.
      Leonard had been ruined absolutely, and had appeared to her as a man
      apart, isolated from the world. A real man, who cared for adventure and
      beauty, who desired to live decently and pay his way, who could have
      travelled more gloriously through life than the juggernaut car that was
      crushing him. Memories of Evie&rsquo;s wedding had warped her, the starched
      servants, the yards of uneaten food, the rustle of overdressed women,
      motor-cars oozing grease on the gravel, a pretentious band. She had tasted
      the lees of this on her arrival; in the darkness, after failure, they
      intoxicated her. She and the victim seemed alone in a world of unreality,
      and she loved him absolutely, perhaps for half an hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the morning she was gone. The note that she left, tender and hysterical
      in tone, and intended to be most kind, hurt her lover terribly. It was as
      if some work of art had been broken by him, some picture in the National
      Gallery slashed out of its frame. When he recalled her talents and her
      social position, he felt that the first passer-by had a right to shoot him
      down. He was afraid of the waitress and the porters at the
      railway-station. He was afraid at first of his wife, though later he was
      to regard her with a strange new tenderness, and to think, &ldquo;There is
      nothing to choose between us, after all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The expedition to Shropshire crippled the Basts permanently. Helen in her
      flight forgot to settle the hotel bill, and took their return tickets away
      with her; they had to pawn Jacky&rsquo;s bangles to get home, and the smash came
      a few days afterwards. It is true that Helen offered him five thousand
      pounds, but such a sum meant nothing to him. He could not see that the
      girl was desperately righting herself, and trying to save something out of
      the disaster, if it was only five thousand pounds. But he had to live
      somehow. He turned to his family, and degraded himself to a professional
      beggar. There was nothing else for him to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A letter from Leonard,&rdquo; thought Blanche, his sister; &ldquo;and after all this
      time.&rdquo; She hid it, so that her husband should not see, and when he had
      gone to his work read it with some emotion, and sent the prodigal a little
      money out of her dress allowance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A letter from Leonard!&rdquo; said the other sister, Laura, a few days later.
      She showed it to her husband. He wrote a cruel, insolent reply, but sent
      more money than Blanche, so Leonard soon wrote to him again.
    </p>
    <p>
      And during the winter the system was developed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard realised that they need never starve, because it would be too
      painful for his relatives. Society is based on the family, and the clever
      wastrel can exploit this indefinitely. Without a generous thought on
      either side, pounds and pounds passed. The donors disliked Leonard, and he
      grew to hate them intensely. When Laura censured his immoral marriage, he
      thought bitterly, &ldquo;She minds that! What would she say if she knew the
      truth?&rdquo; When Blanche&rsquo;s husband offered him work, he found some pretext for
      avoiding it. He had wanted work keenly at Oniton, but too much anxiety had
      shattered him, he was joining the unemployable. When his brother, the
      lay-reader, did not reply to a letter, he wrote again, saying that he and
      Jacky would come down to his village on foot. He did not intend this as
      blackmail. Still the brother sent a postal order, and it became part of
      the system. And so passed his winter and his spring.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the horror there are two bright spots. He never confused the past. He
      remained alive, and blessed are those who live, if it is only to a sense
      of sinfulness. The anodyne of muddledom, by which most men blur and blend
      their mistakes, never passed Leonard&rsquo;s lips&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
        &ldquo;And if I drink oblivion of a day,
         So shorten I the stature of my soul.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      It is a hard saying, and a hard man wrote it, but it lies at the root of
      all character.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the other bright spot was his tenderness for Jacky. He pitied her with
      nobility now&mdash;not the contemptuous pity of a man who sticks to a
      woman through thick and thin. He tried to be less irritable. He wondered
      what her hungry eyes desired&mdash;nothing that she could express, or that
      he or any man could give her. Would she ever receive the justice that is
      mercy&mdash;the justice for by-products that the world is too busy to
      bestow? She was fond of flowers, generous with money, and not revengeful.
      If she had borne him a child he might have cared for her. Unmarried,
      Leonard would never have begged; he would have flickered out and died. But
      the whole of life is mixed. He had to provide for Jacky, and went down
      dirty paths that she might have a few feathers and the dishes of food that
      suited her.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day he caught sight of Margaret and her brother. He was in St. Paul&rsquo;s.
      He had entered the cathedral partly to avoid the rain and partly to see a
      picture that had educated him in former years. But the light was bad, the
      picture ill placed, and Time and judgment were inside him now. Death alone
      still charmed him, with her lap of poppies, on which all men shall sleep.
      He took one glance, and turned aimlessly away towards a chair. Then down
      the nave he saw Miss Schlegel and her brother. They stood in the fairway
      of passengers, and their faces were extremely grave. He was perfectly
      certain that they were in trouble about their sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once outside&mdash;and he fled immediately&mdash;he wished that he had
      spoken to them. What was his life? What were a few angry words, or even
      imprisonment? He had done wrong&mdash;that was the true terror. Whatever
      they might know, he would tell them everything he knew. He re-entered St.
      Paul&rsquo;s. But they had moved in his absence, and had gone to lay their
      difficulties before Mr. Wilcox and Charles.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sight of Margaret turned remorse into new channels. He desired to
      confess, and though the desire is proof of a weakened nature, which is
      about to lose the essence of human intercourse, it did not take an ignoble
      form. He did not suppose that confession would bring him happiness. It was
      rather that he yearned to get clear of the tangle. So does the suicide
      yearn. The impulses are akin, and the crime of suicide lies rather in its
      disregard for the feelings of those whom we leave behind. Confession need
      harm no one&mdash;it can satisfy that test&mdash;and though it was
      un-English, and ignored by our Anglican cathedral, Leonard had a right to
      decide upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, he trusted Margaret. He wanted her hardness now. That cold,
      intellectual nature of hers would be just, if unkind. He would do whatever
      she told him, even if he had to see Helen. That was the supreme punishment
      she would exact. And perhaps she would tell him how Helen was. That was
      the supreme reward.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew nothing about Margaret, not even whether she was married to Mr.
      Wilcox, and tracking her out took several days. That evening he toiled
      through the wet to Wickham Place, where the new flats were now appearing.
      Was he also the cause of their move? Were they expelled from society on
      his account? Thence to a public library, but could find no satisfactory
      Schlegel in the directory. On the morrow he searched again. He hung about
      outside Mr. Wilcox&rsquo;s office at lunch time, and, as the clerks came out
      said, &ldquo;Excuse me, sir, but is your boss married?&rdquo; Most of them stared,
      some said, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that to you?&rdquo; but one, who had not yet acquired
      reticence, told him what he wished. Leonard could not learn the private
      address. That necessitated more trouble with directories and tubes. Ducie
      Street was not discovered till the Monday, the day that Margaret and her
      husband went down on their hunting expedition to Howards End.
    </p>
    <p>
      He called at about four o&rsquo;clock. The weather had changed, and the sun
      shone gaily on the ornamental steps&mdash;black and white marble in
      triangles. Leonard lowered his eyes to them after ringing the bell. He
      felt in curious health; doors seemed to be opening and shutting inside his
      body, and he had been obliged to sleep sitting up in bed, with his back
      propped against the wall. When the parlourmaid came he could not see her
      face; the brown rain had descended suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does Mrs. Wilcox live here?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s out,&rdquo; was the answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When will she be back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll ask,&rdquo; said the parlourmaid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret had given instructions that no one who mentioned her name should
      ever be rebuffed. Putting the door on the chain&mdash;for Leonard&rsquo;s
      appearance demanded this&mdash;she went through to the smoking-room, which
      was occupied by Tibby. Tibby was asleep. He had had a good lunch. Charles
      Wilcox had not yet rung him up for the distracting interview. He said
      drowsily: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Hilton. Howards End. Who is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll ask, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t bother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have taken the car to Howards End,&rdquo; said the parlourmaid to Leonard.
    </p>
    <p>
      He thanked her, and asked whereabouts that place was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You appear to want to know a good deal,&rdquo; she remarked. But Margaret had
      forbidden her to be mysterious. She told him against her better judgment
      that Howards End was in Hertfordshire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it a village, please?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Village! It&rsquo;s Mr. Wilcox&rsquo;s private house&mdash;at least, it&rsquo;s one of
      them. Mrs. Wilcox keeps her furniture there. Hilton is the village.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. And when will they be back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Schlegel doesn&rsquo;t know. We can&rsquo;t know everything, can we?&rdquo; She shut
      him out, and went to attend to the telephone, which was ringing furiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      He loitered away another night of agony. Confession grew more difficult.
      As soon as possible he went to bed. He watched a patch of moonlight cross
      the floor of their lodging, and, as sometimes happens when the mind is
      overtaxed, he fell asleep for the rest of the room, but kept awake for the
      patch of moonlight. Horrible! Then began one of those disintegrating
      dialogues. Part of him said: &ldquo;Why horrible? It&rsquo;s ordinary light from the
      moon.&rdquo; &ldquo;But it moves.&rdquo; &ldquo;So does the moon.&rdquo; &ldquo;But it is a clenched fist.&rdquo;
       &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; &ldquo;But it is going to touch me.&rdquo; &ldquo;Let it.&rdquo; And, seeming to gather
      motion, the patch ran up his blanket. Presently a blue snake appeared;
      then another parallel to it. &ldquo;Is there life in the moon?&rdquo; &ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;
       &ldquo;But I thought it was uninhabited.&rdquo; &ldquo;Not by Time, Death, Judgment, and the
      smaller snakes.&rdquo; &ldquo;Smaller snakes!&rdquo; said Leonard indignantly and aloud.
      &ldquo;What a notion!&rdquo; By a rending effort of the will he woke the rest of the
      room up. Jacky, the bed, their food, their clothes on the chair, gradually
      entered his consciousness, and the horror vanished outwards, like a ring
      that is spreading through water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, Jacky, I&rsquo;m going out for a bit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was breathing regularly. The patch of light fell clear of the striped
      blanket, and began to cover the shawl that lay over her feet. Why had he
      been afraid? He went to the window, and saw that the moon was descending
      through a clear sky. He saw her volcanoes, and the bright expanses that a
      gracious error has named seas. They paled, for the sun, who had lit them
      up, was coming to light the earth. Sea of Serenity, Sea of Tranquillity,
      Ocean of the Lunar Storms, merged into one lucent drop, itself to slip
      into the sempiternal dawn. And he had been afraid of the moon!
    </p>
    <p>
      He dressed among the contending lights, and went through his money. It was
      running low again, but enough for a return ticket to Hilton. As it
      clinked, Jacky opened her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hullo, Len! What ho, Len!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What ho, Jacky! see you again later.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned over and slept.
    </p>
    <p>
      The house was unlocked, their landlord being a salesman at Covent Garden.
      Leonard passed out and made his way down to the station. The train, though
      it did not start for an hour, was already drawn up at the end of the
      platform, and he lay down in it and slept. With the first jolt he was in
      daylight; they had left the gateways of King&rsquo;s Cross, and were under blue
      sky. Tunnels followed, and after each the sky grew bluer, and from the
      embankment at Finsbury Park he had his first sight of the sun. It rolled
      along behind the eastern smokes&mdash;a wheel, whose fellow was the
      descending moon&mdash;and as yet it seemed the servant of the blue sky,
      not its lord. He dozed again. Over Tewin Water it was day. To the left
      fell the shadow of the embankment and its arches; to the right Leonard saw
      up into the Tewin Woods and towards the church, with its wild legend of
      immortality. Six forest trees&mdash;that is a fact&mdash;grow out of one
      of the graves in Tewin churchyard. The grave&rsquo;s occupant&mdash;that is the
      legend&mdash;is an atheist, who declared that if God existed, six forest
      trees would grow out of her grave. These things in Hertfordshire; and
      farther afield lay the house of a hermit&mdash;Mrs. Wilcox had known him&mdash;who
      barred himself up, and wrote prophecies, and gave all he had to the poor.
      While, powdered in between, were the villas of business men, who saw life
      more steadily, though with the steadiness of the half-closed eye. Over all
      the sun was streaming, to all the birds were singing, to all the primroses
      were yellow, and the speedwell blue, and the country, however they
      interpreted her, was uttering her cry of &ldquo;now.&rdquo; She did not free Leonard
      yet, and the knife plunged deeper into his heart as the train drew up at
      Hilton. But remorse had become beautiful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hilton was asleep, or at the earliest, breakfasting. Leonard noticed the
      contrast when he stepped out of it into the country. Here men had been up
      since dawn. Their hours were ruled, not by a London office, but by the
      movements of the crops and the sun. That they were men of the finest type
      only the sentimentalists can declare. But they kept to the life of
      daylight. They are England&rsquo;s hope. Clumsily they carry forward the torch
      of the sun, until such time as the nation sees fit to take it up. Half
      clodhopper, half board-school prig, they can still throw back to a nobler
      stock, and breed yeomen.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the chalk pit a motor passed him. In it was another type, whom Nature
      favours&mdash;the Imperial. Healthy, ever in motion, it hopes to inherit
      the earth. It breeds as quickly as the yeoman, and as soundly; strong is
      the temptation to acclaim it as a super-yeoman, who carries his country&rsquo;s
      virtue overseas. But the Imperialist is not what he thinks or seems. He is
      a destroyer. He prepares the way for cosmopolitanism, and though his
      ambitions may be fulfilled, the earth that he inherits will be grey.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Leonard, intent on his private sin, there came the conviction of innate
      goodness elsewhere. It was not the optimism which he had been taught at
      school. Again and again must the drums tap, and the goblins stalk over the
      universe before joy can be purged of the superficial. It was rather
      paradoxical, and arose from his sorrow. Death destroys a man, but the idea
      of death saves him&mdash;that is the best account of it that has yet been
      given. Squalor and tragedy can beckon to all that is great in us, and
      strengthen the wings of love. They can beckon; it is not certain that they
      will, for they are not love&rsquo;s servants. But they can beckon, and the
      knowledge of this incredible truth comforted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he approached the house all thought stopped. Contradictory notions
      stood side by side in his mind. He was terrified but happy, ashamed, but
      had done no sin. He knew the confession: &ldquo;Mrs. Wilcox, I have done wrong,&rdquo;
       but sunrise had robbed its meaning, and he felt rather on a supreme
      adventure.
    </p>
    <p>
      He entered a garden, steadied himself against a motor-car that he found in
      it, found a door open and entered a house. Yes, it would be very easy.
      From a room to the left he heard voices, Margaret&rsquo;s amongst them. His own
      name was called aloud, and a man whom he had never seen said, &ldquo;Oh, is he
      there? I am not surprised. I now thrash him within an inch of his life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Wilcox,&rdquo; said Leonard, &ldquo;I have done wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man took him by the collar and cried, &ldquo;Bring me a stick.&rdquo; Women were
      screaming. A stick, very bright, descended. It hurt him, not where it
      descended, but in the heart. Books fell over him in a shower. Nothing had
      sense.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get some water,&rdquo; commanded Charles, who had all through kept very calm.
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s shamming. Of course I only used the blade. Here, carry him out into
      the air.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thinking that he understood these things, Margaret obeyed him. They laid
      Leonard, who was dead, on the gravel; Helen poured water over him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough,&rdquo; said Charles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, murder&rsquo;s enough,&rdquo; said Miss Avery, coming out of the house with the
      sword.

      CHAPTER XLII
    </h2>
    <p>
      When Charles left Ducie Street he had caught the first train home, but had
      no inkling of the newest development until late at night. Then his father,
      who had dined alone, sent for him, and in very grave tones inquired for
      Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where she is, pater&rdquo; said Charles. &ldquo;Dolly kept back dinner
      nearly an hour for her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me when she comes in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Another hour passed. The servants went to bed, and Charles visited his
      father again, to receive further instructions. Mrs. Wilcox had still not
      returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll sit up for her as late as you like, but she can hardly be coming.
      Isn&rsquo;t she stopping with her sister at the hotel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; said Mr. Wilcox thoughtfully&mdash;&ldquo;perhaps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I do anything for you, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not to-night, my boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wilcox liked being called sir. He raised his eyes, and gave his son
      more open a look of tenderness than he usually ventured. He saw Charles as
      little boy and strong man in one. Though his wife had proved unstable his
      children were left to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      After midnight he tapped on Charles&rsquo;s door. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t sleep,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I
      had better have a talk with you and get it over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He complained of the heat. Charles took him out into the garden, and they
      paced up and down in their dressing-gowns. Charles became very quiet as
      the story unrolled; he had known all along that Margaret was as bad as her
      sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She will feel differently in the morning,&rdquo; said Mr. Wilcox, who had of
      course said nothing about Mrs. Bast. &ldquo;But I cannot let this kind of thing
      continue without comment. I am morally certain that she is with her sister
      at Howards End. The house is mine&mdash;and, Charles, it will be yours&mdash;and
      when I say that no one is to live there, I mean that no one is to live
      there. I won&rsquo;t have it.&rdquo; He looked angrily at the moon. &ldquo;To my mind this
      question is connected with something far greater, the rights of property
      itself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Undoubtedly,&rdquo; said Charles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wilcox linked his arm in his son&rsquo;s, but somehow liked him less as he
      told him more. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want you to conclude that my wife and I had
      anything of the nature of a quarrel. She was only overwrought, as who
      would not be? I shall do what I can for Helen, but on the understanding
      that they clear out of the house at once. Do you see? That is a sine qua
      non.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then at eight to-morrow I may go up in the car?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eight or earlier. Say that you are acting as my representative, and, of
      course, use no violence, Charles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the morrow, as Charles returned, leaving Leonard dead upon the gravel,
      it did not seem to him that he had used violence. Death was due to heart
      disease. His stepmother herself had said so, and even Miss Avery had
      acknowledged that he only used the flat of the sword. On his way through
      the village he informed the police, who thanked him, and said there must
      be an inquest. He found his father in the garden shading his eyes from the
      sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has been pretty horrible,&rdquo; said Charles gravely. &ldquo;They were there, and
      they had the man up there with them too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&mdash;what man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you last night. His name was Bast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God! is it possible?&rdquo; said Mr. Wilcox. &ldquo;In your mother&rsquo;s house!
      Charles, in your mother&rsquo;s house!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, pater. That was what I felt. As a matter of fact, there is no
      need to trouble about the man. He was in the last stages of heart disease,
      and just before I could show him what I thought of him he went off. The
      police are seeing about it at this moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wilcox listened attentively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I got up there&mdash;oh, it couldn&rsquo;t have been more than half-past seven.
      The Avery woman was lighting a fire for them. They were still upstairs. I
      waited in the drawing-room. We were all moderately civil and collected,
      though I had my suspicions. I gave them your message, and Mrs. Wilcox
      said, &lsquo;Oh yes, I see; yes,&rsquo; in that way of hers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I promised to tell you, &lsquo;with her love,&rsquo; that she was going to Germany
      with her sister this evening. That was all we had time for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wilcox seemed relieved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because by then I suppose the man got tired of hiding, for suddenly Mrs.
      Wilcox screamed out his name. I recognised it, and I went for him in the
      hall. Was I right, pater? I thought things were going a little too far.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right, my dear boy? I don&rsquo;t know. But you would have been no son of mine
      if you hadn&rsquo;t. Then did he just&mdash;just&mdash;crumple up as you said?&rdquo;
       He shrunk from the simple word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He caught hold of the bookcase, which came down over him. So I merely put
      the sword down and carried him into the garden. We all thought he was
      shamming. However, he&rsquo;s dead right enough. Awful business!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sword?&rdquo; cried his father, with anxiety in his voice. &ldquo;What sword? Whose
      sword?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A sword of theirs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What were you doing with it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, didn&rsquo;t you see, pater, I had to snatch up the first thing handy. I
      hadn&rsquo;t a riding-whip or stick. I caught him once or twice over the
      shoulders with the flat of their old German sword.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He pulled over the bookcase, as I said, and fell,&rdquo; said Charles, with a
      sigh. It was no fun doing errands for his father, who was never quite
      satisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the real cause was heart disease? Of that you&rsquo;re sure?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That or a fit. However, we shall hear more than enough at the inquest on
      such unsavoury topics.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They went in to breakfast. Charles had a racking headache, consequent on
      motoring before food. He was also anxious about the future, reflecting
      that the police must detain Helen and Margaret for the inquest and ferret
      the whole thing out. He saw himself obliged to leave Hilton. One could not
      afford to live near the scene of a scandal&mdash;it was not fair on one&rsquo;s
      wife. His comfort was that the pater&rsquo;s eyes were opened at last. There
      would be a horrible smash-up, and probably a separation from Margaret;
      then they would all start again, more as they had been in his mother&rsquo;s
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll go round to the police-station,&rdquo; said his father when
      breakfast was over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What for?&rdquo; cried Dolly, who had still not been &ldquo;told.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, sir. Which car will you have?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll walk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good half-mile,&rdquo; said Charles, stepping into the garden. &ldquo;The
      sun&rsquo;s very hot for April. Shan&rsquo;t I take you up, and then, perhaps, a
      little spin round by Tewin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You go on as if I didn&rsquo;t know my own mind,&rdquo; said Mr. Wilcox fretfully.
      Charles hardened his mouth. &ldquo;You young fellows&rsquo; one idea is to get into a
      motor. I tell you, I want to walk; I&rsquo;m very fond of walking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, all right; I&rsquo;m about the house if you want me for anything. I thought
      of not going up to the office to-day, if that is your wish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is, indeed, my boy,&rdquo; said Mr. Wilcox, and laid a hand on his sleeve.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charles did not like it; he was uneasy about his father, who did not seem
      himself this morning. There was a petulant touch about him&mdash;more like
      a woman. Could it be that he was growing old? The Wilcoxes were not
      lacking in affection; they had it royally, but they did not know how to
      use it. It was the talent in the napkin, and, for a warm-hearted man,
      Charles had conveyed very little joy. As he watched his father shuffling
      up the road, he had a vague regret&mdash;a wish that something had been
      different somewhere&mdash;a wish (though he did not express it thus) that
      he had been taught to say &ldquo;I&rdquo; in his youth. He meant to make up for
      Margaret&rsquo;s defection, but knew that his father had been very happy with
      her until yesterday. How had she done it? By some dishonest trick, no
      doubt&mdash;but how?
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wilcox reappeared at eleven, looking very tired. There was to be an
      inquest on Leonard&rsquo;s body to-morrow, and the police required his son to
      attend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I expected that,&rdquo; said Charles. &ldquo;I shall naturally be the most important
      witness there.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Out of the turmoil and horror that had begun with Aunt Juley&rsquo;s illness and
      was not even to end with Leonard&rsquo;s death, it seemed impossible to Margaret
      that healthy life should re-emerge. Events succeeded in a logical, yet
      senseless, train. People lost their humanity, and took values as arbitrary
      as those in a pack of playing-cards. It was natural that Henry should do
      this and cause Helen to do that, and then think her wrong for doing it;
      natural that she herself should think him wrong; natural that Leonard
      should want to know how Helen was, and come, and Charles be angry with him
      for coming&mdash;natural, but unreal. In this jangle of causes and effects
      what had become of their true selves? Here Leonard lay dead in the garden,
      from natural causes; yet life was a deep, deep river, death a blue sky,
      life was a house, death a wisp of hay, a flower, a tower, life and death
      were anything and everything, except this ordered insanity, where the king
      takes the queen, and the ace the king. Ah, no; there was beauty and adventure
      behind, such as the man at her feet had yearned for; there was hope this
      side of the grave; there were truer relationships beyond the limits that
      fetter us now. As a prisoner looks up and sees stars beckoning, so she,
      from the turmoil and horror of those days, caught glimpses of the diviner
      wheels.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Helen, dumb with fright, but trying to keep calm for the child&rsquo;s sake,
      and Miss Avery, calm, but murmuring tenderly, &ldquo;No one ever told the lad
      he&rsquo;ll have a child&rdquo;&mdash;they also reminded her that horror is not the
      end. To what ultimate harmony we tend she did not know, but there seemed
      great chance that a child would be born into the world, to take the great
      chances of beauty and adventure that the world offers. She moved through
      the sunlit garden, gathering narcissi, crimson-eyed and white. There was
      nothing else to be done; the time for telegrams and anger was over and it
      seemed wisest that the hands of Leonard should be folded on his breast and
      be filled with flowers. Here was the father; leave it at that. Let Squalor
      be turned into Tragedy, whose eyes are the stars, and whose hands hold the
      sunset and the dawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      And even the influx of officials, even the return of the doctor, vulgar
      and acute, could not shake her belief in the eternity of beauty. Science
      explained people, but could not understand them. After long centuries
      among the bones and muscles it might be advancing to knowledge of the
      nerves, but this would never give understanding. One could open the heart
      to Mr. Mansbridge and his sort without discovering its secrets to them,
      for they wanted everything down in black and white, and black and white
      was exactly what they were left with.
    </p>
    <p>
      They questioned her closely about Charles. She never suspected why. Death
      had come, and the doctor agreed that it was due to heart disease. They
      asked to see her father&rsquo;s sword. She explained that Charles&rsquo;s anger was
      natural, but mistaken. Miserable questions about Leonard followed, all of
      which she answered unfalteringly. Then back to Charles again. &ldquo;No doubt
      Mr. Wilcox may have induced death,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;but if it wasn&rsquo;t one thing
      it would have been another as you know.&rdquo; At last they thanked her and took
      the sword and the body down to Hilton. She began to pick up the books from
      the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen had gone to the farm. It was the best place for her, since she had
      to wait for the inquest. Though, as if things were not hard enough, Madge
      and her husband had raised trouble; they did not see why they should
      receive the offscourings of Howards End. And, of course, they were right.
      The whole world was going to be right, and amply avenge any brave talk
      against the conventions. &ldquo;Nothing matters,&rdquo; the Schlegels had said in the
      past, &ldquo;except one&rsquo;s self-respect and that of one&rsquo;s friends.&rdquo; When the time
      came, other things mattered terribly. However, Madge had yielded, and
      Helen was assured of peace for one day and night, and to-morrow she would
      return to Germany.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for herself, she determined to go too. No message came from Henry;
      perhaps he expected her to apologise. Now that she had time to think over
      her own tragedy, she was unrepentant. She neither forgave him for his
      behaviour nor wished to forgive him. Her speech to him seemed perfect. She
      would not have altered a word. It had to be uttered once in a life, to
      adjust the lopsidedness of the world. It was spoken not only to her
      husband, but to thousands of men like him&mdash;a protest against the
      inner darkness in high places that comes with a commercial age. Though he
      would build up his life without hers, she could not apologise. He had
      refused to connect, on the clearest issue that can be laid before a man,
      and their love must take the consequences.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, there was nothing more to be done. They had tried not to go over the
      precipice, but perhaps the fall was inevitable. And it comforted her to
      think that the future was certainly inevitable; cause and effect would go
      jangling forward to some goal doubtless, but to none that she could
      imagine. At such moments the soul retires within, to float upon the bosom
      of a deeper stream, and has communion with the dead, and sees the world&rsquo;s
      glory not diminished, but different in kind to what she has supposed. She
      alters her focus until trivial things are blurred. Margaret had been
      tending this way all the winter. Leonard&rsquo;s death brought her to the goal.
      Alas! that Henry should fade away as reality emerged, and only her love
      for him should remain clear, stamped with his image like the cameos we
      rescue out of dreams.
    </p>
    <p>
      With unfaltering eye she traced his future. He would soon present a
      healthy mind to the world again, and what did he or the world care if he
      was rotten at the core? He would grow into a rich, jolly old man, at times
      a little sentimental about women, but emptying his glass with anyone.
      Tenacious of power, he would keep Charles and the rest dependent, and
      retire from business reluctantly and at an advanced age. He would settle
      down&mdash;though she could not realise this. In her eyes Henry was always
      moving and causing others to move, until the ends of the earth met. But in
      time he must get too tired to move, and settle down. What next? The
      inevitable word. The release of the soul to its appropriate Heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      Would they meet in it? Margaret believed in immortality for herself. An
      eternal future had always seemed natural to her. And Henry believed in it
      for himself. Yet, would they meet again? Are there not rather endless
      levels beyond the grave, as the theory that he had censured teaches? And
      his level, whether higher or lower, could it possibly be the same as hers?
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus gravely meditating, she was summoned by him. He sent up Crane in the
      motor. Other servants passed like water, but the chauffeur remained,
      though impertinent and disloyal. Margaret disliked Crane, and he knew it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it the keys that Mr. Wilcox wants?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t say, madam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t any note for me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t say, madam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After a moment&rsquo;s thought she locked up Howards End. It was pitiable to see
      in it the stirrings of warmth that would be quenched for ever. She raked
      out the fire that was blazing in the kitchen, and spread the coals in the
      gravelled yard. She closed the windows and drew the curtains. Henry would
      probably sell the place now.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was determined not to spare him, for nothing new had happened as far
      as they were concerned. Her mood might never have altered from yesterday
      evening. He was standing a little outside Charles&rsquo;s gate, and motioned the
      car to stop. When his wife got out he said hoarsely: &ldquo;I prefer to discuss
      things with you outside.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be more appropriate in the road, I am afraid,&rdquo; said Margaret.
      &ldquo;Did you get my message?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to Germany with my sister. I must tell you now that I shall
      make it my permanent home. Our talk last night was more important than you
      have realised. I am unable to forgive you and am leaving you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am extremely tired,&rdquo; said Henry, in injured tones. &ldquo;I have been walking
      about all the morning, and wish to sit down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, if you will consent to sit on the grass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Great North Road should have been bordered all its length with glebe.
      Henry&rsquo;s kind had filched most of it. She moved to the scrap opposite,
      wherein were the Six Hills. They sat down on the farther side, so that
      they could not be seen by Charles or Dolly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here are your keys,&rdquo; said Margaret. She tossed them towards him. They
      fell on the sunlit slope of grass, and he did not pick them up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have something to tell you,&rdquo; he said gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      She knew this superficial gentleness, this confession of hastiness, that
      was only intended to enhance her admiration of the male.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to hear it,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;My sister is going to be ill. My
      life is going to be with her now. We must manage to build up something,
      she and I and her child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Munich. We start after the inquest, if she is not too ill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After the inquest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you realised what the verdict at the inquest will be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, heart disease.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my dear; manslaughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret drove her fingers through the grass. The hill beneath her moved
      as if it were alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Manslaughter,&rdquo; repeated Mr. Wilcox. &ldquo;Charles may go to prison. I dare not
      tell him. I don&rsquo;t know what to do&mdash;what to do. I&rsquo;m broken&mdash;I&rsquo;m
      ended.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No sudden warmth arose in her. She did not see that to break him was her
      only hope. She did not enfold the sufferer in her arms. But all through
      that day and the next a new life began to move. The verdict was brought
      in. Charles was committed for trial. It was against all reason that he
      should be punished, but the law, notwithstanding, sentenced him to three
      years&rsquo; imprisonment. Then Henry&rsquo;s fortress gave way. He could bear no one
      but his wife; he shambled up to Margaret afterwards and asked her to do
      what she could with him. She did what seemed easiest&mdash;she took him
      down to recruit at Howards End.

    <p>
      Tom&rsquo;s father was cutting the big meadow. He passed again and again amid
      whirring blades and sweet odours of grass, encompassing with narrowing
      circles the sacred centre of the field. Tom was negotiating with Helen. &ldquo;I
      haven&rsquo;t any idea,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;Do you suppose baby may, Meg?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret put down her work and regarded them absently. &ldquo;What was that?&rdquo;
       she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tom wants to know whether baby is old enough to play with hay?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the least notion,&rdquo; answered Margaret, and took up her work
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Tom, baby is not to stand; he is not to lie on his face; he is not
      to lie so that his head wags; he is not to be teased or tickled; and he is
      not to be cut into two or more pieces by the cutter. Will you be as
      careful as all that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tom held out his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That child is a wonderful nursemaid,&rdquo; remarked Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is fond of baby. That&rsquo;s why he does it!&rdquo; was Helen&rsquo;s answer. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re
      going to be lifelong friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Starting at the ages of six and one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. It will be a great thing for Tom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may be a greater thing for baby.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fourteen months had passed, but Margaret still stopped at Howards End. No
      better plan had occurred to her. The meadow was being recut, the great red
      poppies were reopening in the garden. July would follow with the little
      red poppies among the wheat, August with the cutting of the wheat. These
      little events would become part of her year after year. Every summer she
      would fear lest the well should give out, every winter lest the pipes
      should freeze; every westerly gale might blow the wych-elm down and bring
      the end of all things, and so she could not read or talk during a westerly
      gale. The air was tranquil now. She and her sister were sitting on the
      remains of Evie&rsquo;s rockery, where the lawn merged into the field.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a time they all are!&rdquo; said Helen. &ldquo;What can they be doing inside?&rdquo;
       Margaret, who was growing less talkative, made no answer. The noise of the
      cutter came intermittently, like the breaking of waves. Close by them a
      man was preparing to scythe out one of the dell-holes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish Henry was out to enjoy this,&rdquo; said Helen. &ldquo;This lovely weather and
      to be shut up in the house! It&rsquo;s very hard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has to be,&rdquo; said Margaret. &ldquo;The hay fever is his chief objection
      against living here, but he thinks it worth while.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meg, is or isn&rsquo;t he ill? I can&rsquo;t make out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not ill. Eternally tired. He has worked very hard all his life, and
      noticed nothing. Those are the people who collapse when they do notice a
      thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose he worries dreadfully about his part of the tangle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dreadfully. That is why I wish Dolly had not come, too, to-day. Still, he
      wanted them all to come. It has to be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why does he want them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret did not answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meg, may I tell you something? I like Henry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;d be odd if you didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I usen&rsquo;t to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Usen&rsquo;t!&rdquo; She lowered her eyes a moment to the black abyss of the past.
      They had crossed it, always excepting Leonard and Charles. They were
      building up a new life, obscure, yet gilded with tranquillity. Leonard was
      dead; Charles had two years more in prison. One usen&rsquo;t always to see
      clearly before that time. It was different now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like Henry because he does worry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he likes you because you don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen sighed. She seemed humiliated, and buried her face in her hands.
      After a time she said: &ldquo;About love,&rdquo; a transition less abrupt than it
      appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret never stopped working.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean a woman&rsquo;s love for a man. I supposed I should hang my life on to
      that once, and was driven up and down and about as if something was
      worrying through me. But everything is peaceful now; I seem cured. That
      Herr Forstmeister, whom Frieda keeps writing about, must be a noble
      character, but he doesn&rsquo;t see that I shall never marry him or anyone. It
      isn&rsquo;t shame or mistrust of myself. I simply couldn&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m ended. I used to
      be so dreamy about a man&rsquo;s love as a girl, and think that for good or evil
      love must be the great thing. But it hasn&rsquo;t been; it has been itself a
      dream. Do you agree?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not agree. I do not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ought to remember Leonard as my lover,&rdquo; said Helen, stepping down into
      the field. &ldquo;I tempted him, and killed him, and it is surely the least I
      can do. I would like to throw out all my heart to Leonard on such an
      afternoon as this. But I cannot. It is no good pretending. I am forgetting
      him.&rdquo; Her eyes filled with tears. &ldquo;How nothing seems to match&mdash;how,
      my darling, my precious&mdash;&rdquo; She broke off. &ldquo;Tommy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, please?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Baby&rsquo;s not to try and stand.&mdash;There&rsquo;s something wanting in me. I see
      you loving Henry, and understanding him better daily, and I know that
      death wouldn&rsquo;t part you in the least. But I&mdash;Is it some awful,
      appalling, criminal defect?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret silenced her. She said: &ldquo;It is only that people are far more
      different than is pretended. All over the world men and women are worrying
      because they cannot develop as they are supposed to develop. Here and
      there they have the matter out, and it comforts them. Don&rsquo;t fret yourself,
      Helen. Develop what you have; love your child. I do not love children. I
      am thankful to have none. I can play with their beauty and charm, but that
      is all&mdash;nothing real, not one scrap of what there ought to be. And
      others&mdash;others go farther still, and move outside humanity
      altogether. A place, as well as a person, may catch the glow. Don&rsquo;t you
      see that all this leads to comfort in the end? It is part of the battle
      against sameness. Differences, eternal differences, planted by God in a
      single family, so that there may always be colour; sorrow perhaps, but
      colour in the daily grey. Then I can&rsquo;t have you worrying about Leonard.
      Don&rsquo;t drag in the personal when it will not come. Forget him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, but what has Leonard got out of life?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps an adventure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that enough?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not for us. But for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen took up a bunch of grass. She looked at the sorrel, and the red and
      white and yellow clover, and the quaker grass, and the daisies, and the
      bents that composed it. She raised it to her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it sweetening yet?&rdquo; asked Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, only withered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will sweeten to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen smiled. &ldquo;Oh, Meg, you are a person,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Think of the racket
      and torture this time last year. But now I couldn&rsquo;t stop unhappy if I
      tried. What a change&mdash;and all through you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, we merely settled down. You and Henry learnt to understand one
      another and to forgive, all through the autumn and the winter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but who settled us down?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret did not reply. The scything had begun, and she took off her
      pince-nez to watch it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You!&rdquo; cried Helen. &ldquo;You did it all, sweetest, though you&rsquo;re too stupid to
      see. Living here was your plan&mdash;I wanted you; he wanted you; and
      everyone said it was impossible, but you knew. Just think of our lives
      without you, Meg&mdash;I and baby with Monica, revolting by theory, he
      handed about from Dolly to Evie. But you picked up the pieces, and made us
      a home. Can&rsquo;t it strike you&mdash;even for a moment&mdash;that your life
      has been heroic? Can&rsquo;t you remember the two months after Charles&rsquo;s arrest,
      when you began to act, and did all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were both ill at the time,&rdquo; said Margaret. &ldquo;I did the obvious things.
      I had two invalids to nurse. Here was a house, ready furnished and empty.
      It was obvious. I didn&rsquo;t know myself it would turn into a permanent home.
      No doubt I have done a little towards straightening the tangle, but things
      that I can&rsquo;t phrase have helped me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope it will be permanent,&rdquo; said Helen, drifting away to other
      thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think so. There are moments when I feel Howards End peculiarly our
      own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the same, London&rsquo;s creeping.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She pointed over the meadow&mdash;over eight or nine meadows, but at the
      end of them was a red rust.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see that in Surrey and even Hampshire now,&rdquo; she continued. &ldquo;I can see
      it from the Purbeck Downs. And London is only part of something else, I&rsquo;m
      afraid. Life&rsquo;s going to be melted down, all over the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret knew that her sister spoke truly. Howards End, Oniton, the
      Purbeck Downs, the Oderberge, were all survivals, and the melting-pot was
      being prepared for them. Logically, they had no right to be alive. One&rsquo;s
      hope was in the weakness of logic. Were they possibly the earth beating
      time?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because a thing is going strong now, it need not go strong for ever,&rdquo; she
      said. &ldquo;This craze for motion has only set in during the last hundred
      years. It may be followed by a civilisation that won&rsquo;t be a movement,
      because it will rest on the earth. All the signs are against it now, but I
      can&rsquo;t help hoping, and very early in the morning in the garden I feel that
      our house is the future as well as the past.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They turned and looked at it. Their own memories coloured it now, for
      Helen&rsquo;s child had been born in the central room of the nine. Then Margaret
      said, &ldquo;Oh, take care&mdash;!&rdquo; for something moved behind the window of the
      hall, and the door opened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The conclave&rsquo;s breaking at last. I&rsquo;ll go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was Paul.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen retreated with the children far into the field. Friendly voices
      greeted her. Margaret rose, to encounter a man with a heavy black
      moustache.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father has asked for you,&rdquo; he said with hostility.
    </p>
    <p>
      She took her work and followed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have been talking business,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;but I dare say you knew
      all about it beforehand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clumsy of movement&mdash;for he had spent all his life in the saddle&mdash;Paul
      drove his foot against the paint of the front door. Mrs. Wilcox gave a
      little cry of annoyance. She did not like anything scratched; she stopped
      in the hall to take Dolly&rsquo;s boa and gloves out of a vase.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her husband was lying in a great leather chair in the dining-room, and by
      his side, holding his hand rather ostentatiously, was Evie. Dolly, dressed
      in purple, sat near the window. The room was a little dark and airless;
      they were obliged to keep it like this until the carting of the hay.
      Margaret joined the family without speaking; the five of them had met
      already at tea, and she knew quite well what was going to be said. Averse
      to wasting her time, she went on sewing. The clock struck six.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this going to suit everyone?&rdquo; said Henry in a weary voice. He used the
      old phrases, but their effect was unexpected and shadowy. &ldquo;Because I don&rsquo;t
      want you all coming here later on and complaining that I have been
      unfair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s apparently got to suit us,&rdquo; said Paul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon, my boy. You have only to speak, and I will leave the
      house to you instead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Paul frowned ill-temperedly, and began scratching at his arm. &ldquo;As I&rsquo;ve
      given up the outdoor life that suited me, and I have come home to look
      after the business, it&rsquo;s no good my settling down here,&rdquo; he said at last.
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not really the country, and it&rsquo;s not the town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. Does my arrangement suit you, Evie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you, Dolly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dolly raised her faded little face, which sorrow could wither but not
      steady. &ldquo;Perfectly splendidly,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I thought Charles wanted it for
      the boys, but last time I saw him he said no, because we cannot possibly
      live in this part of England again. Charles says we ought to change our
      name, but I cannot think what to, for Wilcox just suits Charles and me,
      and I can&rsquo;t think of any other name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a general silence. Dolly looked nervously round, fearing that
      she had been inappropriate. Paul continued to scratch his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I leave Howards End to my wife absolutely,&rdquo; said Henry. &ldquo;And let
      everyone understand that; and after I am dead let there be no jealousy and
      no surprise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret did not answer. There was something uncanny in her triumph. She,
      who had never expected to conquer anyone, had charged straight through
      these Wilcoxes and broken up their lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In consequence, I leave my wife no money,&rdquo; said Henry. &ldquo;That is her own
      wish. All that she would have had will be divided among you. I am also
      giving you a great deal in my lifetime, so that you may be independent of
      me. That is her wish, too. She also is giving away a great deal of money.
      She intends to diminish her income by half during the next ten years; she
      intends when she dies to leave the house to her nephew, down in the field.
      Is all that clear? Does everyone understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Paul rose to his feet. He was accustomed to natives, and a very little
      shook him out of the Englishman. Feeling manly and cynical, he said: &ldquo;Down
      in the field? Oh, come! I think we might have had the whole establishment,
      piccaninnies included.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Cahill whispered: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, Paul. You promised you&rsquo;d take care.&rdquo;
       Feeling a woman of the world, she rose and prepared to take her leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her father kissed her. &ldquo;Good-bye, old girl,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you worry
      about me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, dad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then it was Dolly&rsquo;s turn. Anxious to contribute, she laughed nervously,
      and said: &ldquo;Good-bye, Mr. Wilcox. It does seem curious that Mrs. Wilcox
      should have left Margaret Howards End, and yet she get it, after all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From Evie came a sharply-drawn breath. &ldquo;Goodbye,&rdquo; she said to Margaret,
      and kissed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      And again and again fell the word, like the ebb of a dying sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, Dolly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So long, father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, my boy; always take care of yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, Mrs. Wilcox.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret saw their visitors to the gate. Then she returned to her husband
      and laid her head in his hands. He was pitiably tired. But Dolly&rsquo;s remark
      had interested her. At last she said: &ldquo;Could you tell me, Henry, what was
      that about Mrs. Wilcox having left me Howards End?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tranquilly he replied: &ldquo;Yes, she did. But that is a very old story. When
      she was ill and you were so kind to her she wanted to make you some
      return, and, not being herself at the time, scribbled &lsquo;Howards End&rsquo; on a
      piece of paper. I went into it thoroughly, and, as it was clearly
      fanciful, I set it aside, little knowing what my Margaret would be to me
      in the future.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret was silent. Something shook her life in its inmost recesses, and
      she shivered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t do wrong, did I?&rdquo; he asked, bending down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t, darling. Nothing has been done wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From the garden came laughter. &ldquo;Here they are at last!&rdquo; exclaimed Henry,
      disengaging himself with a smile. Helen rushed into the gloom, holding Tom
      by one hand and carrying her baby on the other. There were shouts of
      infectious joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The field&rsquo;s cut!&rdquo; Helen cried excitedly&mdash;&ldquo;the big meadow! We&rsquo;ve seen
      to the very end, and it&rsquo;ll be such a crop of hay as never!&rdquo;
     </p>

&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
